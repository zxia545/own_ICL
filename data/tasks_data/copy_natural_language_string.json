Most of the water comes from 347 glaciers with a total area of 29.45 square kilometers in the upstream catchment. The northwest flows through Shule Gorge, Naliu Gorge and Liugou Gorge into the Changmabao Basin. After exiting Changma Gorge, it forms the largest alluvial fan in the Hexi Corridor, the Changma alluvial fan, and flows along the fan edge to Guazhou through the west turn of Yumen City. The Shuangta Reservoir in the county flows into the Anxi-Dunhuang Basin, flows westward to the Changma Reservoir in Yumen City, and enters the Hala Lake in the Lop Nor desert after the confluence of Dang River in Dunhuang City. The upper reaches of Changma Reservoir are the upper reaches, the flat land of the Hexi Corridor from Changma Gorge to Shuangta Reservoir is the middle reaches, and the lower reaches of the Shuangta Reservoir to the Lop Nor desert are the lower reaches.\nHydrology.\nThe c6803ea75c870d0e has a total length of 861 kilometers, with a water-bearing section of about 770 kilometers in summer and 540 kilometers in winter, with a catchment area of 20,197 square kilometers and a drainage area of 102,300 square kilometers, with an average flow of 28.8m3/s and the maximum flow rate is 1,620m3/s.

        "content": "7e51437c2a76794a is the second solo album by Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, released in 1994. It is the first album in Dickinson's solo career that was released after he had officially left Iron Maiden (although he rejoined again in 1999).\nThis record marked the beginning of Dickinson's collaborations with guitarist Roy Z, who would work on many of Dickinson's later albums including \"Accident of Birth\", \"The Chemical Wedding\" and \"Tyranny of Souls\". Stylistically it departs from \"Tattooed Millionaire\" but is still more traditional-sounding than the follow-up album \"Skunkworks\" released in 1996. Later, Dickinson said that he and Roy Z were talked into making the album less heavy than it should have been.\nOverview.\nDickinson started working on his second solo album while still in Iron Maiden. For the very first recording sessions he recruited the British band Skin. Not satisfied with the style of the effort, Dickinson aborted the recording. His next attempt at a second solo album was a collaboration with producer Keith Olsen. \"Over and Out\", \"Tibet\", \"Tears of the Dragon (First Bit, Long Bit, Last Bit)\", \"Cadillac Gas Mask\", and \"No Way Out...Continued\" are all songs recorded with Olsen and set for inclusion on the second, aborted version of \"7e51437c2a76794a\", also referred to by insiders as \"The Peter Gabriel Album\". Other songs from these sessions that have yet to surface on any Dickinson release include \"Man of Sorrows\" (re-recorded for \"Accident of Birth\"; an older demo version from 1990 appears on \"The Best of Bruce Dickinson\"), \"Original Sin\" and \"Thank Heaven\".\nDickinson decided to scrap this project as well and teamed up with guitarist Roy Z and his band Tribe of Gypsies to write and record \"7e51437c2a76794a\". The song \"Change of Heart\" was originally written and demoed by Roy Z and vocalist Rob Rock with their band Driver. Dickinson changed the lyrics for the version that was recorded for \"7e51437c2a76794a\". Z and Rock finally recorded and released their version when Driver reunited for their 2008 debut album, \"Sons of Thunder\". Songs from the previous recording sessions later resurfaced as b-sides on singles from \"7e51437c2a76794a\" and subsequently also as bonus tracks on the album's 2005 extended edition.\nIn the \"Anthology\" DVD, Dickinson said that he regrets not naming the album \"Laughing in the Hiding Bush\" after the song of the same name. The song itself is dedicated to his son, Austin, who penned the title.\n\"",

        "content": "0a232a66859c31ab (; Medieval Greek: , \"Chranisthlavos\") (fl. 1278–1304) was a Bulgarian military commander who was a close associate of rebel leader and later Tsar Ivaylo (r. 1277–1280). After being captured by the Byzantines, 0a232a66859c31ab entered the service of Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) as his \"megas tzaousios\". As a Byzantine officer, he commanded a detachment which assisted the Catalan Company in the anti-Turkish wars in Asia Minor.\nBiography.\nFew details are known about 0a232a66859c31ab prior to his capture by the Byzantines. Byzantine historian George Pachymeres describes him as a \"warlike man, a Bulgarian by descent\" and one of Ivaylo's officers and supporters. Historian Plamen Pavlov theorizes that 0a232a66859c31ab must have been an early follower of Ivaylo from the very outbreak of his uprising and thus one of his most trusted commanders. He believes 0a232a66859c31ab was granted the Byzantine loan-title of \"megas primikerios\" after Ivaylo was installed in the capital Tarnovo.\n0a232a66859c31ab was taken captive by the armies of Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), whose campaigns against Bulgaria in 1278–1280 sought to eliminate Ivaylo and put Ivan Asen III (r. 1279–1280) on the Bulgarian throne. 0a232a66859c31ab had to spend at least a few years imprisoned in Constantinople before Michael's son and next Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos released him. Andronikos desired to make use of 0a232a66859c31ab's military talents and elevated him to the status of \"megas tzaousios\". Bulgarian scholars interpret the role of the \"megas tzaousios\" as the head of the imperial guard and a chief assistant of the \"megas primikerios\". In fact, the nature of this military office, which derives from Turkish \"çavuş\", \"messenger\", is far from clear.\nIn his new duty as a Byzantine general, 0a232a66859c31ab was deployed to northwest Asia Minor, where his major task was the defence of that province against the advancing Turks. He was subordinate to the Western mercenary Roger de Flor and his Catalan Company, though he stood in charge of a separate military unit. His forces may have included a Bulgarian participation of unknown number.\n0a232a66859c31ab's detachment took part in the Byzantine–Catalan victory over the Turks at Germe in the spring of 1304. However, the distribution of loot proved to be a major matter of dispute between Roger and 0a232a66859c31ab. The former accused the latter of greediness and in the ensuing conflict hanged twelve of his soldiers. Roger even stabbed 0a232a66859c31ab with his sword and was about to hang him, had it not been for the intervention of other Byzantine generals, who saved the Bulgarian due to his \"many praiseworthy acts\". Nothing is known of 0a232a66859c31ab's destiny after 1304, although he is not mentioned to have died from his wounds.\nLegacy.\n0a232a66859c31ab is briefly referenced in national writer Ivan Vazov's 1907 novel \"Svetoslav Terter\". In one of the chapters, the book tells the story of 0a232a66859c31ab's fictional nephew Radoil, a brigand and adventurer who fought the Tatars of Nogai Khan and the Seljuks. In Vazov's novel, ",

Vinton (17 February 1806 – 31 March 1858) was an American Baptist missionary who worked for 25 years in Burma (now known as Myanmar) preaching the gospel amongst the Karen people.\nEarly life.\n521351caba13f591 was born on in Willington, Connecticut. He attended the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution (later known as Madison University and finally as Colgate University). In 1833 the missionary to Burma, Jonathan Wade, on his medical furlough spent the year at the Institution giving instructions to the future missionaries. Among the future missionaries were 521351caba13f591 and Calista Holman. Jonathan Wade also brought with him two of his disciples, a Burmese named Maung Shwe Maung and a Karen named Saw Chet Thaing. Justus and Calista received Karen language lessons from Saw Chet Thaing.\nJustus married Calista Holman in 1834, and three months later set sail to Burma in company with other missionaries: Mr. and Mrs. Wade, Mr. and Mrs. Howard, Mr and Mrs. Dean, and Mr. and Mrs. Osgood and the two disciples. The voyage took one hundred and sixty days, normal for the period. Justus and Calista studied the Karen language on the voyage. In addition the missionaries preached the gospel to the crew. During the voyage they converted the captain, the first officer, the steward, supercargo, and many sailors.\nLife in Moulmein.\nThey disembarked in Moulmein (also known as Mawlamyine) in December 1834. Since Justus and Calista were sufficiently familiar with the language, they began their mission work at once. They took native canoes and visited many jungle Karen villages preaching the gospel and seeking to convert people to their religion.\nDuring the monsoon (raining) season, when travelling was impossible, the Vintons were confined to the city. they learned Burmese language and Justus labored among the British soldiers in the garrison and preaching and distributing religious tracts among the Burmese. He also worked on the translation of the New Testament into Karen and wrote commentaries. Between 1834 and 1848, Justus labors were confined to Moulmein district with occasional visits to Rangoon (now known as Yangon) and Tavoy (now known as Dawei). On his frequent visits to Rangoon he baptized many people. Rangoon was still under Burmese rule at that time, but Adoniram Judson's disciple Saw Tha Byu and Rev. Abbott had converted many Karens around Rangoon and little churches had been set up. Many young Karen men travelled on foot to Moulmein through the forest to go to the school established by Calista Vinton. There they learned to read in the written form of their language that the missionaries had developed.\nIn 1841, 22-year-old Justus's sister Miranda joined them for mission work and worked as a teacher. The Vintons had a son, Brainerd, and a daughter Calista.\nSojourn in America.\nIn 1847 Mrs. Vinton's health failed and she returned to America for treatment. Justus visited the Baptist churches in almost all the states and raised funds for the indebted Baptist Missionary Union. In July 1850 the Vintons returned by sea to Burma, accompanied by many missionaries, including Jonathan Wade and Eugenio Kincaid and their wives.\nCall to Rangoon.\nIn 1852 a British frigate and four armed steamers arrived at the port of Rangoon to demand redress of grievances from the Burmese government. The local authorities prepared for resistance by erecting immense stockades and placing batteries at various points. Reinforcements called from surrounding areas maltreated the populace.\nRev. Eugenio Kincaid, who was in Rangoon at that time, asked Justus to come to Rangoon and help with relief work. The fellow missionaries at Moulmein also agreed that he should go. Justus went to Rangoon at once; waiting for a formal authorization of his transfer from the Baptist Mission Union would have required six to eight months. When he reached Rangoon five thousand refugee Karens were living in precarious conditions. Rangoon fell to the British on 12 April 1852 in the Second Anglo-Burmese War, but elements of the disbanded local army continued to harass the people. Six weeks after the capture of Rangoon, 521351caba13f591's family joined him in Rangoon. They set up an emergency hospital in a vacant monastery. Calista also set up a school, and two hundred pupils attended.\nFamine followed the war and pestilence. 521351caba13f591 bought provisions and fed thousands of refugees.\nIn 1854 Karen Home Mission Society was formed. At their first annual meeting, thirty pastors and three hundred lay delegates were in attendance. In 1855 a two-storey Karen Baptist church was built, and the Vinton's son Brainerd went to study at Hamilton, NY and the daughter Calista went to study at Suffolk. Miranda died after working with her brother for twelve years.\nThe Baptist Mission Union censured 521351caba13f591 for abandoning his post without authorization and going to Rangoon; he resigned from the Missionary Union and accepted, unpaid, the affiliation of American Baptist Free Mission Society. The Society acted as a financial agent in the collection and transmission of funds and in publication in the country of his reports and letters. Besides funds donated by friends in America, his mission was supported by native Christians and British residents in Rangoon.\nIn 1858 Justus went to Shwekyin to find appropriate locations for posting native preachers; he contracted a jungle fever there, and died on 31 March 1858. Calista carried on the mission work, assisted by her son Brainerd and daughter Calista and their spouses, who returned from America after their studies.\nIn 1872, long after the death of ",

        "content": "7a3fe146823a0fc5 (; ; c. 399–395 BC), by Plato, is a Socratic dialogue whose events occur in the weeks before the trial of Socrates (399 BC), between Socrates and 7a3fe146823a0fc5. The dialogue covers subjects such as the meaning of piety and justice. As is common with Plato's earliest dialogues, it ends in aporia.\nIn this dialogue, Socrates meets 7a3fe146823a0fc5 at the porch of the archon basileus (the 'king magistrate') at that time. Socrates tells him that he is preparing to go to court against the charges of Meletus on the grounds of impiety. 7a3fe146823a0fc5 tells Socrates that he is going to court himself to prosecute his father for binding a worker in chains and leaving him to die. This has granted him the ire of his own family who believe his father was in the right. The worker had killed a fellow worker, which they believe exempts his father from liability for leaving him bound in the ditch to starve to death. Since 7a3fe146823a0fc5 seems assured of himself, Socrates asks him to define piety. His help will clarify Socrates' case in the courtroom. If Socrates is asked to define piety, he can simply rely on 7a3fe146823a0fc5's definition. This however leads to the main dilemma of the dialogue when the two cannot come to a satisfactory conclusion. Is something pious because the gods approve of it or do the gods approve of it because it is pious? This aporic ending has led to one of the longest theological and meta-ethical debates in history.\nBackground.\nThe dialogue in \"7a3fe146823a0fc5\" occurs near the court of the \"archon basileus\" (king magistrate), where Socrates and 7a3fe146823a0fc5 encounter each other; each man is present at the court for the preliminary hearings to possible trials (2a).\n7a3fe146823a0fc5 has come to present charges of murder against his own father who, after arresting one of his workers (Thetes) for killing a slave from the family estate on Naxos Island, tied him and threw him in a ditch where he died of exposure to the elements (3e–4d) while 7a3fe146823a0fc5's father waited to hear from the exegetes (\"cf.\" Laws 759d) about how to proceed. Socrates is astonished by 7a3fe146823a0fc5's confidence in being able to prosecute his own father for the serious charge of manslaughter, despite the fact that Athenian Law allows only relatives of the dead man to file suit for murder (Dem. 43 §57). 7a3fe146823a0fc5 dismisses the astonishment of Socrates, which confirms his overconfidence in his own critical judgment of religious and ethical matters.\nIn an example of Socratic irony, Socrates says that 7a3fe146823a0fc5 obviously has a clear understanding of what is pious or holy (τὸ ὅσιον \"to hosion\") and impious or unholy (τὸ ἀνόσιον \"to anosion\"). Because he is facing a formal charge of impiety, Socrates expresses the hope to learn from 7a3fe146823a0fc5, all the better to defend himself in the trial, as he himself is being accused of religious transgressions.\n7a3fe146823a0fc5 says that what lies behind the charge of impiety presented against Socrates, by Meletus and the others, is Socrates' claim that he is subjected to a \"daimon\" (divine sign), which warns him of various courses of action (3b). From the perspective of some Athenians, Socrates expressed skepticism of the accounts about the Greek gods, which he and 7a3fe146823a0fc5 briefly discuss, before proceeding to the main argument of their dialogue: the definition of \"piety\". Moreover, Socrates further expresses critical reservations about such divine accounts that emphasize the cruelty and inconsistent behaviour of the Greek gods, such as the castration of the early sky-god Uranus, by his son Cronus; a story Socrates said is difficult to accept (6a–6c).\nAfter claiming to know and be able to tell more astonishing divine stories, 7a3fe146823a0fc5 spends little time and effort defending the conventional Greek view of the gods. Instead, he is led to the true task at hand, as Socrates forces him to confront his ignorance by pressing 7a3fe146823a0fc5 for a definition of \"piety\"; yet, Socrates finds flaw with each definition of \"piety\" proposed by 7a3fe146823a0fc5 (6d ff.).\nAt the dialogue's conclusion, 7a3fe146823a0fc5 is compelled to admit that each of his definitions of \"piety\" has failed, but, rather than correct his faulty logic, he says that it is time for him to leave, and excuses himself from their dialogue. To that end, Socrates concludes the dialogue with Socratic irony: Since 7a3fe146823a0fc5 was unable to define \"piety\", 7a3fe146823a0fc5 has failed to teach Socrates about piety. Therefore, from his dialogue with 7a3fe146823a0fc5, Socrates received nothing helpful to his defense against a formal charge of impiety (15c ff.).\nIt is easier to understand Socrates' arguments in this dialogue if the reader keeps in mind that Athenian religion revolved around specific rituals and practices with no reference to sacred scripture, at least in the same sense as later Abrahamic religions. Priests might worship only one specific god while not paying respect to the others. 7a3fe146823a0fc5 uses Zeus as evidence for his notions of piety while disregarding Uranus and Cronus, for example.\nThe argument.\nSocrates asks 7a3fe146823a0fc5 to offer him a definition of piety or holiness. The purpose of establishing a clear definition is to provide a basis for 7a3fe146823a0fc5 to teach Socrates the answer to the question: \"What is piety?\" Ostensibly, the purpose of the dialogue is to provide Socrates with a definitive meaning of \"piety\", with which he can defend against the charge of impiety in the pending trial.\nSocrates seeks a definition of \"piety\" that is a universal (universally true), against which all actions can be measured to determine whether or not the actions are pious. To be universal, the definition of \"piety\" must express the 'essence'  of the thing defined (piety), a clear and unambiguous standard to which each particular instance of piety will conform.\nThe dialogue.\nOstensibly in order to better defend himself in an upcoming trial for being an impious citizen of Athens, Socrates asks 7a3fe146823a0fc5 for a clear definition of \"piety\" (holiness); he offers Socrates four definitions.\nFirst definition.\n7a3fe146823a0fc5's first definition of piety is what he is doing now, that is, prosecuting his father for manslaughter (5d). Socrates rejects 7a3fe146823a0fc5's definition, because it is not a definition of piety, and is only an \"example\" of piety, and does not provide the essential characteristic that makes pious actions pious.\nSecond definition.\n7a3fe146823a0fc5's second definition: Piety is what is \"pleasing\" to the gods. (6e–7a) Socrates applauds this definition, because it is expressed in a general form, but criticizes it saying that the gods disagree among themselves as to what is pleasing. This means that a given action, disputed by the gods, would be both pious and impious at the same time – a logical impossibility. 7a3fe146823a0fc5 argues against Socrates' criticism, by noting that not even the gods would disagree, among themselves, that someone who kills without justification should be punished. Yet Socrates argues that disputes would still arise – over just how much justification actually existed; hence, the same action could be pious and impious; again, 7a3fe146823a0fc5's definition cannot be a definition of \"piety\".\nThird definition.\nTo overcome Socrates' objection to his second definition of piety, 7a3fe146823a0fc5 amends his definition. (9e)\n7a3fe146823a0fc5's third definition of piety is: \"What \"all\" the gods love is pious, and what they \"all\" hate is impious.\" In reply, Socrates poses the question that would eventually become known in philosophy as the 7a3fe146823a0fc5 dilemma: \"Is the pious loved by the gods \"because\" it is pious? Or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\". 7a3fe146823a0fc5 seems unsure as to what the question means and so Socrates applies a dialectic technique: an analogy, to clarify his question (10a).

Located in the Central Business District (CBD), it is the third tallest building in both the city of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana.\nThe building has been unused since 2002 because of environmental problems such as toxic mold and asbestos.\nHistory.\nConstruction of the ac0a383195e76a6d began in 1964, as a project of developer Sam J. Recile, but halted in October 1966. The property was bought out and construction resumed in 1968, and completed in 1969. The ac0a383195e76a6d was the tallest building in New Orleans and Louisiana for four years until One Shell Square surpassed it by over .\nAlong with the World Trade Center on the Mississippi riverfront, the ac0a383195e76a6d marked the beginning of modern high-rises in New Orleans. The building has always held a prominent place in the city's skyline, even after the 1970s building boom on along Canal Street and the 1980s boom along Poydras Street. This is due to both its unique design, particularly its \"crown top,\" and its location on the extreme edge of the CBD.\nThe ac0a383195e76a6d was originally designed primarily as an office building with some residential space on the upper floors. Upon completion of the tower, very little residential space was made available. By 1984 the remaining residential apartments were made into offices.\nIn 2001, tenants began to publicly criticize the building's owners for ignoring worsening conditions in the building. Claims were made that a lack of proper maintenance had led to exposure to asbestos and toxic mold. Several class action lawsuits were filed by workers against the owners and managers and their own employers, the Louisiana Department of Social Services and Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. In 2002 approximately 700 Louisiana state and New Orleans District Attorney's Office employees relocated en masse to offices on Common Street. Since that time, the building has sat sealed off and unused.\nProposed rebirth as Crescent City Towers.\nFor several years in the late 2000s a plan was in the news to redevelop ac0a383195e76a6d as residential space under the name \"Crescent City Towers\" or variations on that name.\nA plan claimed to begin by gutting the building down to its superstructure, both on the interior and exterior, required because of the building's history with asbestos, toxic mold and water leaks. The proposed new facade would feature a neomodern look, making extensive use of glass and staggered balconies, to provide the units with views of the New Orleans skyline and the Mississippi River. Once complete, the building would have included amenities such as a gourmet restaurant, spa, fitness center, indoor pool and retail space. The renovation of an adjoining building containing a 350-space parking garage and several townhouse units was also planned. The redesign was originally proposed under the name Crescent City Residences.\nThe architectural team behind the redesign was composed of Williams Architects of New Orleans and Marks Thomas Architects of Baltimore. Dorian M. Bennett Realtors Inc. had exclusive rights to sell the 350 units, with prices starting at $350,000. Unit sizes were determined, but prices were planned to be in the range of $450 per square foot, similar to prices in the French Quarter, and about $100 per square foot higher than the nearby Warehouse District.\nIn November 2005, Giannasca Development Group announced it had secured $24 million to start the redevelopment project. A construction timetable was being developed in light of delays and logistical issues since Hurricane Katrina, with estimates for an opening date in 2008.\nIn spring 2006, modified plans were released reflecting changes aimed at addressing post-Katrina concerns. This redesign includes glass designed to withstand winds, a self-contained electrical generator, and an internal water supply, which developers say could make the building self-sufficient for three to four weeks. The external design was also changed to a cleaner glass and steel design, removing the needle point and multiedged surfaces of the original design. This new exterior was to consist of gold-tinted wall to wall glass and maroon steel. The price of the project increased from $100 million to $120 million while the number of units has been reduced from 350 to 197. These units were to run from starting at $450,000 to several units costing several million dollars. Three quarters of the units were to have only one bedroom. The project also saw a slight name change to the Crescent City Towers.\nIn July 2007, the owners defaulted on the mortgage and the ac0a383195e76a6ds was put on the auction block. Howard Acquisitions, LLC already held the mortgage on the building. Their winning bid protects their investment and gives them full control over the high-rise. The new owners, Plainfield Direct, are remaining tight-lipped about their plans for the building.\nOn December 19, 2007, Plainfield Direct paid the City of New Orleans $608,000 in back taxes and announced plans to spend $10 million on environmental remediation. This work was set to begin immediately in the parking garage and building annex, work was to begin in the tower in early 2008. Following the remediation work, Plainfield was to partner with developers to put the building back into use.\nSuch plans were not met with success. In July 2011, the still vacant building was announced to be up for auction with bids due by 20 September. Bryan Burns purchased the building for $650,000 at a private auction in December 2011, although the listed price was $15.5 million in 2010.\n In September 2014 the building was again sold, this time for an undisclosed amount to Alexandra Land and Development LLC. \nDebris and fire and continued decay.\nOn May 20, 2021, a piece of the ac0a383195e76a6d fell from top of the building, injuring one person. This debris caused the closure of many major roads in New Orleans such as parts of Howard Avenue and Loyola Avenue. New Orleans officials and Jaeger stated that the property would receive new fencing and a net that would catch any more debris, were it to fall off of the building. More roads were subsequently added to the closure list. These closures will be in place until a new fence is put up around the building and when the area is deemed safe for pedestrians. The area around the ac0a383195e76a6d reopened on July 16 after netting was placed at the top of the building to catch any more debris, were it to fall from the building.\nIn the early morning hours of January 10, 2022, a fire was reported in the ",

The Castle is known for its collection of massive horseshoes and is also recognised as one of the best examples of domestic Norman architecture in England. It is a Grade I listed building. Owned and managed by the Rutland County Council, b070ee26e0f04ef5 is licensed for civil ceremonies. Admission to the castle is free.\nHistory.\nThe Castle was built between 1180 and 1190 by Walkelin de Ferrers, lord of the manor of Oakham, and a great nephew of Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby. The Great Hall comprises a nave and two arcaded aisles, each with three large stone columns. There are a number of 12th-century sculptures decorating the Hall including six musicians that are supported by the columns. The sculptures are carved from local stone quarried at Clipsham and are believed to have been made by masons who had also worked at Canterbury Cathedral.\nb070ee26e0f04ef5 is one of the longest-running seats of justice in England; a Crown Court has been held in the castle every two years since 1229.\nThe present gateway into the market place closely resembles the gateways at Burley-on-the-Hill, and is thought to have been erected by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in the early 17th century.\nFollowing the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became the meeting place for Rutland County Council and remained as such until the County Council moved to Catmose House in 1936.\n\"Time Team\", the Channel 4 archaeology series, filmed at b070ee26e0f04ef5 26–28 June 2012; the programme was shown on 10 February 2013.\nThe Castle was temporarily closed for an extensive restoration of the Castle, including the curtain wall. b070ee26e0f04ef5 was awarded a £2.165 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 following a joint bid by Rutland County Council, Oakham Town Council and the Friends of Rutland County Museum. The castle reopened on 30 May 2016.\nDescription.\nDue to its small size, b070ee26e0f04ef5 does not represent the traditional image of a castle. However, what is now called b070ee26e0f04ef5 was originally the Great Hall of a much larger fortified manor house. This had many of the traditional features of a castle such as a curtain wall, a gatehouse and a drawbridge with iron chains. There is also historical and archaeological evidence to suggest that b070ee26e0f04ef5 possessed towers at strategic points along the walls as well as a moat. An illustration in \"Mediaeval England\" edited by H. W. C. Davis suggests that the doorway shown to be in the centre of the wall was originally where the window at the end on the right now is. Also, there are no dormer windows in the illustration.\nThe Horseshoes.\nThere remains a unique tradition that peers of the realm should forfeit a horseshoe to the Lord of the Manor of Oakham on their first visit to the town.

Recent additions to the collection are horseshoes presented by the Princess Royal in 1999, the Prince of Wales in 2003, Princess Alexandra in 2005 and the Duchess of Cornwall in 2014",

        "content": "An idol  refers to a type of celebrity working in the field of K-pop in fandom culture in South Korea, either as a member of a group or as a solo act. K-pop idols are characterized by the highly manufactured star system that they are produced by and debuted under, as well as their tendency to represent a hybridized convergence of visuals, music, fashion, and dance. They usually work for a mainstream entertainment agency and have undergone extensive training in dance, vocals, and foreign language. Idols maintain a carefully curated public image and social media presence, and dedicate significant time and resources to building relationships with fans through concerts and meetups.\nTrainee system.\nInspired by the heyday of MTV in the United States, Lee Soo-man set his sights on laying the foundation for the modern Korean pop music industry. He witnessed New Kids on the Block became very popular in Korea in the 1990s.The K-pop trainee system was popularised by Lee Soo-man, the founder of SM Entertainment. Hundreds of candidates each day attend the global auditions held by Korean entertainment agencies to perform for the chance of becoming a trainee. This was part of a concept labelled cultural technology.\nThe trainee process lasts for an indefinite period of time, ranging from months to years, and usually involves vocal, dance, and language classes taken while living together with other trainees, who sometimes attend school at the same time, although some trainees drop out of school to focus on their careers.\nOnce a trainee enters the system, they are regulated in multiple aspects including personal life, physical condition, and visual appearance. The survival, and training and regulation take precedence over natural talent in the production of b08c36296de8b90bs. The system requires trainees to maintain a \"wholesome image\" while remaining \"private about their lives and thoughts\".\nFormer trainees have reported that they were required to go through plastic surgeries, such as a Blepharoplasty or a Rhinoplasty, in order to adhere to the acceptable Korean beauty standards. Further criticism towards the trainee system arose regarding the companies' harsh weight restrictions, which often caused trainees to pass out from exhaustion or dehydration in an attempt to reach the required weight for their desired program. \nThe investment on a potential trainee could be expensive. In 2012, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that the cost of training one member of Girls' Generation under SM Entertainment was US$3 million.\nPersonal image.\nWhen trainees are finally chosen to debut in new groups, they will face a new setting of personalities created by the company to cater the entertainment market. Each member of an idol group has his or her own character to play and therefore an important part of their job duties is to maintain that temperament in any kind of exposure they may get. One way to build the personal image of idol groups is through social media services with content managed by the company to ensure the consistency of these personal characteristics.\nRelationship with fans.\nThe relationship between b08c36296de8b90bs and their fans can be characterized as \"parasocial kin\", which means for fans to create a familial connection with their idols rather than just being a \"look-from-afar\" fan. In some cases, within and outside of fandoms, fans also create familial connections with other fans through similar interests or just to make friends. These interactions can be initiated by the fans, the company, or the idols themselves, where they would most likely still have to go through their company to be approved. Some projects or activities, created by fans for the idols, must also be approved by the venue or the idols’ company to minimize any harm to the idols and fan-participants. Interactions and fan connections can be seen through events like fan meetings, also known as artist engagements, concerts or fansites, and artist cafés. An annual event known as KCon is also a place for fans and artists to interact. The nature of this \"parasocial kin\" relationship can also be seen in the proactive participation of b08c36296de8b90b fans in production of idol groups. Even before debut, some trainees would already have their own fans. This leads to the \"kinship\" starting out early, and building that up is very important for the idol as an artist and the fan as a supporter. Once debuted, fans grow alongside their idols and idol-fan relationships become deeper. If anything happens, fans have their own unique ways to show their attitude and opinion on issues concerning \"unfair\" actions of management companies. Under this situation, fans often appear to be protecting idols from company mistreatment due to the familial connection built between both sides.\nWorking conditions.\nSeveral b08c36296de8b90b groups and solo artists have resented the contracts issued to them by their management companies, claiming that the decade-long contracts are \"too long, too restrictive, and gave them almost none of the profits from their success\". A director of South Korean entertainment agency DSP Media stated that the company does share profit with the performers, but often little is left over after paying costs. Korean entertainment companies such as S.M Entertainment have been called \"factories\" for their unique method of mass-producing stars. Members of groups are frequently retired and replaced with fresh trainees when their age or musical inclinations begin to pose a problem. TVXQ charged S.M. Entertainment for unreasonable terms in their contracts with the company in 2009.\nCommercialism.\nEntertainment companies in Korea use a boot-camp system in grooming their idols. In the case of S.M. Entertainment, the company receives 300,000 applicants in nine countries every year. They possess training facilities in the Gangnam district of Seoul, where recruits then train for years in anticipation of their debut. SM was called the first company to market \"bands as brands\", and commodify not just the artists' product, but the artists themselves. Such techniques have resulted in mass recognition abroad and helped to spark the Korean Wave, which benefits entertainment companies by broadening their audience. As domestic fandom is not generally enough to produce the profits that these corporations and their players require, branding and marketing of the artist/group has become central to industry profits and thus a defining feature of the genre today.\nReported earnings.\nAccording to the South Korean National Tax Service, the average annual earnings for a b08c36296de8b90b in 2013 were KR₩46.74 million (US$42,000). This was almost double the 2010 figure of KR₩26.97 million (US$25,275), a rise attributable to the global spread of \"Hallyu\" in recent years.\nRecognition.\nThe Korean Wave has led to a global rise in interest in b08c36296de8b90bs, along with other aspects of Korean culture including Korean films and K-dramas being exported to other parts of the globe. Along with the Korean Wave, kbeauty has become popular due to the wave and has been rising in popularity worldwide. Korean Idols have influenced the rise in popularity due to their seemingly perfect skin. \nNonetheless, some fanatical behaviors of K-pop idol fans have led to negative stereotypes of K-pop idols in the public, as well as caused criticism in society.\nSexualization.\nThere have been criticisms on the sexual objectification of female and male idols across the industry. The problem is exacerbated due to the higher rigidity of gender norms in contemporary Korean society. Korean censorship practices regarding nudity and obscenity may have further reinforced this objectification.\n",

Under the command of 24e41621af666c8b, a man of \"no lineage\", was the young Alaric of the Balti dynasty. In 395, Stilicho sent him with his troops, under the cover of strengthening the armies of the East, to depose the prefect Rufinus, who was hostile to Stilicho. 24e41621af666c8b murdered Rufinus, but the eunuch Eutropius, who was likewise Stilicho's enemy, gained power. 24e41621af666c8b remained mostly unrewarded by the influential eunuch, which increased his resentment.\nIn 399 he finally rose in stature by replacing \"magister militum\" Leo. This was after the latter failed to quell the insurrection of the Ostrogoths in Asia Minor, led by the chieftain Tribigild, who was also hostile to Eutropius. 24e41621af666c8b too failed to put down the invasions; according to some sources, 24e41621af666c8b was conspiring with Tribigild in order to effect the downfall of Eutropius. After suffering repeated failures against the Ostrogoths, who continued devastating the provinces of Asia Minor, 24e41621af666c8b advised Arcadius to accept Tribigild's terms, which included the death of Eutropius. 24e41621af666c8b then showed his true colors, openly joining Tribigild with all his forces; he forced Arcadius to sign a treaty whereby the Goths would be allowed to settle in Thrace, entrusted with the defense of that frontier against the barbarians beyond the Danube. 24e41621af666c8b proceeded to install his forces in Constantinople, where he ruled for several months. He attempted in effect to copy the success of Stilicho in the West and posed a danger to the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire. He deposed all the anti-Goth officials and had Eutropius executed, though he had previously only been banished; after the intervention of St. John Chrysostom the others were spared.\nWhile a somewhat competent military commander, the zealous Arian 24e41621af666c8b was patently unable to administer a city of 200–400,000 whose Graeco-Roman populace intensely resented barbarian Goths and Arian Christians. 24e41621af666c8b' compromises with Tribigild led to rumors that he had colluded with Tribigild, his kinsman; when he returned to Constantinople in 400, riots broke out. He attempted to evacuate his soldiers but even then the citizens of Constantinople managed to trap and kill 7,000 armed Goths.\nIn response, 24e41621af666c8b and his forces attempted to flee back across the Hellespont, but their rag-tag \"ad hoc\" fleet was met and destroyed by another Goth in Imperial service, Fravitta, who was subsequently made consul for 401 but was later accused of treason and executed as well. After this battle, 24e41621af666c8b fled across the Danube and was caught by the Huns under Uldin. 24e41621af666c8b was killed, and his head was sent by Uldin to Arcadius c. 400 as a diplomatic gift.\nAfter the revolt, Arcadius erected the Column of Arcadius, on which friezes depicted his triumph over 24e41621af666c8b.\n24e41621af666c8b' usurpation is the subject of the \"Egyptian Tale\" and might also be the subject of the speech \"On Imperial Rule\" by Synesius of Cyrene who may have represented an anti-barbarian faction within the Byzantine nobility.\nHerwig Wolfram, the historian of the Goths, notes that the death of ",

        "content": "7c31a2067a1ec1f4 is an American traditional woodworking show hosted by master carpenter Roy Underhill and airing on television network PBS. It is one of the longest running how-to shows on PBS, with thirty-five 13-episode seasons produced. Since its debut in 1979, the show has aired over 400 episodes. The first two seasons were broadcast only on public TV in North Carolina; the season numbering was restarted when the show went national in 1981. It is filmed at the UNC-TV (University of North Carolina Center for Public Television) studios in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.\nOverview.\n\"7c31a2067a1ec1f4\" teaches the art of traditional woodworking, using hand tools and human-powered machines. Viewers learn how to make furniture, toys, and other useful objects out of wood. Viewers also learn how to lay out wood projects and which tools to use for specific purposes. The show also teaches viewers how to use tools properly.\nThe host, Roy Underhill, instructs viewers on creating wooden joints using hand tools and machine tools.\nWood joints.\nUnderhill often shows the viewers how to create several useful and strong wooden joints, which are commonly used in carpentry.\nTimber framing techniques are often used in conjunction with the wood joints described on the show.\nHand tools.\nHand tools are a major focus of the show. All of the hand tools used on the show are manually operated (i.e. non-electric).\nProper handling and maintenance of tools is also part of the show. This includes the sharpening and sometimes making of tools, such as a scraper made from an old saw blade.\nMachine tools.\nThe most commonly used machine tool on the show is the lathe. Underhill typically uses a treadle lathe, but has also shown the viewers how to build and operate a spring pole lathe. He also often uses a gouge, in conjunction with his lathe, to remove material and smooth out a workpiece.\nOne of the simplest types of machines used on the show is a miter box. This is used to create square and perpendicular saw cuts, or to create saw cuts at a specific angle.\nEarly history.\nThe show started as an idea that Roy Underhill had in 1976. He built a workshop and historic museum in Durham, North Carolina, in the mid-1970s. He called it \"7c31a2067a1ec1f4\" and started teaching classes on how to build things out of wood.\nUnderhill pitched the show idea to the PBS affiliate in Chapel Hill in 1978 but was rejected. He tried again in 1979 and filmed a pilot. Only in the fall of 1979 was the show accepted. 1979 was the same year that \"This Old House\" started airing on PBS. Underhill admits that he made up the term \"woodwright\" and that it is not an actual term. Initially, he was concerned about using the made-up term in the show's title, but decided to use it anyway.\nProduction.\nThe show has a tight filming schedule. The show does not have a real script; instead, Underhill works out the story he is going to present and how to do it. He decides where camera shots are needed and sets workpieces and tools in those locations. The filming of different shots is limited to three takes because of the limit of workpieces used on the show.\nIn recent years, the show is filmed in one take with no editing and as a result, the host is often out of breath by the end of the 24 minute program.\nInjuries.\nThe show also does not hide the nicks and cuts that come from woodworking with hand tools. The first such incident occurred in the third episode of the series, \"Dumbheads in Action\". A \"dumbhead\" is a clamping fixture on a foot-operated shaving horse used to hold unseasoned (\"green\") wood.\nOn one occasion, Roy seriously injured his hand with a hatchet. The scene was kept in the show because it was the last take of this particular scene. Underhill reviewed the take and felt that it gave the show some realism.\nHost.\nRoy Underhill is the host and creator of \"7c31a2067a1ec1f4\". He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.F.A. in theater direction. Roy went to Duke University for environmental studies in the mid-1970s. For his thesis, he did a live presentation titled \"How to start with a tree and an axe and build your house and everything in it.\" Somebody told him \"You ought to do that on TV\", when he was finished with his presentation.\nHe went on to work at Colonial Williamsburg as a carpenter, building houses the way they were built in the 18th century. During this same time, he also started producing \"7c31a2067a1ec1f4\" television show for PBS. For 10 years, Underhill was a master housewright for Colonial Williamsburg. He helped with program development for another five years before he left over a disagreement about the authenticity of slave quarters on the project.\nRoy has written several books on woodworking, most of which have been published by the University of North Carolina Press. Some of the books include, \"7c31a2067a1ec1f4: A Practical Guide to Traditional Woodcraft\"  and \"The Woodwright's Guide: Working Wood with Wedge and Edge\" .\nRoy lent his woodworking expertise to the 2005 movie \"The New World\" about the founding of the settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, in the 17th century. He also taught actor Colin Farrell about woodworking for the film and acted as an extra in the movie.\nGuests.\nRoy has had a wide range of woodworking professionals as guests on his show from many different fields of woodworking, Frank Klausz, Christopher Schwarz, Nora Hall, Steve Latta, David Calvo, Michael Dunbar, Dan Mack, Don Weber, Wayne Barton and Curtis Buchanan as well as many lesser-known specialists in the fields of tinsmithing, spoon carving, cooperage (barrels, buckets, canteens), lutherie (stringed instruments), whirligigs, archery, puppetry, basket making, spinning wheels and blacksmithing. Guests have also included famous people with a woodworking hobby, such as Governor Mike Easley.

These three sites are ligand-induced metal-binding site (LIMBS), metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and adjacent to metal ion-dependent adhesion site (ADMIDAS). LIMBS and ADMIDAS sites regulates the cell adherence of lymphocyte by affecting the adhesion or de-adhesion of the integrin to its ligand.\nIn the α4 subunit, Tyr187 was identified as a critical amino acid in integrin α4β7-mediated cell adhesion. Its mutation affects interactions between integrin α4β7 and its ligands. The binding site on the α4 subunit is located on the upper surface of a N-terminal β-propeller structure where this α4 Tyr187 residue is situated.\nFunction.\nc3046c4272621933 is constitutively expressed on naïve T and B cells at relatively low level. Furthermore it is expressed on NK cells, stimulated monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils. Memory gut-homing CD4+ T cells and IgA-secreting B cells have an increased expression of this integrin. Retinoic acid produced by dendritic cells induces upregulation of c3046c4272621933 on these cells. On contrary, most of the memory T cells that circulates to non-mucosal tissues are lacking expression of β7 integrins.\nc3046c4272621933 is a homing receptor that mediates rolling and firm adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. Subsequently this leads to transendothelial lymphocyte diapedesis into mucosal lymphoid tissues with de-adhesion. The primary ligand of c3046c4272621933 is the mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) which is specifically expressed on intestinal lamina propia postcapillary venules and gut secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer’s patches endothelial venules. \nc3046c4272621933 can also bind to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix through a LDV motif on the CS-1 region. c3046c4272621933 binds with less specificity to the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) which usually interacts with integrin α4β7 (VLA-4). \nClinical significance.\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).\nSince c3046c4272621933 interaction with MAdCAM-1 mediates trafficking of immune cells in the gut, unsurprisingly c3046c4272621933 is involved in chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore antagonists of this integrin represent an important therapeutic strategy for IBD. Several monoclonal antibodies have been developed in order to block this interaction and inhibit lymphocytes homing from blood into gut-associated lymphoid tissues. For patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, the expression of MAdCAM-1 is increased in inflamed mucosa. \nNatalizumab (anti-α4) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets α4 subunit therefore it targets both α4β7 and α4β1 integrins. It binds to the α4 β-propeller domain close to the α4-β7 groove. It has been approved for the treatment of both relapsing multiple sclerosis and moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. However, because of potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy it is not usually used. \nVedolizumab (anti-α4β7) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody which has been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. This antibody selectively targets integrin α4β7 binding to MAdCAM-1 and fibronectin but not to VCAM-1. It is the most used anti-integrin therapy in IBD. \nEtrolizumab (anti-β7) is a monoclonal antibody that targets β7 subunit on α4β7 and αEβ7 integrins. It has been shown to be efficient for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in recent clinical trials. \nAbrilumab (anti-α4β7) is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that has been under investigation has another anti-integrin therapy. It was tested for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease and has favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties. \nHIV-1.\nIn acute HIV-1 infection, gastrointestinal dysfunction can be observed. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue represents a key site for HIV-1 replication and mucosal CD4+ T-cell depletion. Therefore the involvement of c3046c4272621933 in HIV-1 pathogenesis has been studied in recent years. It has been found that gp120, which is the major HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, can bind to α4β7 integrin. However α4β7 is not necessary for the HIV-1 infection into host cells. Investigations have been conducted on anti-α4β7 strategies to block HIV-1 infection as potential therapeutics.\nGraft versus host-disease (GVHD).\n",

It was founded in by Arsames I, the Orontid king of Sophene, Commagene and possibly Armenia. The city served as a central center and royal residence of the Orontids of Sophene. The origin of its name was Persian, meaning \"Joy of Arsames\". Naming cities such the \"joy of\" or \"happiness of\" was a Orontid (and later Artaxiad) practice that recalled the Achaemenid royal discourse.\nIt was left and destroyed in the 1st century BC. In the Middle Ages it was called Ashmushat. In Roman and Byzantine times, it bore the names Armosota (Ἀρμόσοτα) and Arsamosota (Ἀρσαμόσοτα). It was also known in Byzantine times as Asmosaton. It was called Shimshāṭ in Arabic. A prominent native of e0f35f2d3d844f15 was the 10th-century poet Abu'l-Hasan Ali al-Shimshati.\ne0f35f2d3d844f15 has been identified with the abandoned settlement site known as Haraba, located by the Murat Su, near the east end of the Altınova plain, some 60 km east of Elazig. Much of the site now lies submerged under the waters of the Keban Dam. The hill that served as the former city's citadel now juts out toward the northeast into a shallow lake created by the dam. The city itself appears to have been just below the hill on the southeast, although this is not entirely certain.\nHistory.\nLimited archaeological evidence, consisting of a few pottery finds that strongly resemble Urartian ceramics, point to the existence of a settlement at e0f35f2d3d844f15 in ancient times - perhaps between the 10th and 7th centuries BCE. However, any settlement here was probably not very significant. The main Urartian settlement in the region was at Harput, which seems to have served as a fortified administrative center. Another large settlement existed at Norşuntepe, although it was unfortified during this period. The local population was at least partly Urartian; there may have also been members of the Mushki people present.\nThe ancient towns at Harput and Norşuntepe dispersed around the Achaemenid period. From then until the foundation of e0f35f2d3d844f15 in the mid-3rd century BCE, the Altınova plain had no large towns. e0f35f2d3d844f15 may have been founded as a display of prestige. Its original population was probably mostly drawn from the surrounding villages. Its location was probably chosen because its distance from the region's main route, which came through the Ergani pass to Tomisa further west, made it relatively safe from attack. However, being off the main trade route also meant that e0f35f2d3d844f15 was not a major commercial center during this period. Its economy was mostly based on agriculture instead.\nIn late antiquity, e0f35f2d3d844f15 formed one of the main settlements in the district of Anzitene. The nearby city of Dadima appears to have grown due to commerce from Ergani and Tomisa by the late 6th century, probably absorbing some of e0f35f2d3d844f15's population. However, e0f35f2d3d844f15 remained a major city with a mixed population of Armenians and Assyrians.\nLater, in the period after the Arab conquest, Dadima shrank to a small town, probably because it was close to the Arab-Byzantine border and therefore prone to attack. Many of its residents moved to e0f35f2d3d844f15, which was in a safer position further east. Some of Melitene's population probably moved to e0f35f2d3d844f15 at this point as well. With Dadima's decline, e0f35f2d3d844f15 was now the lone major city in the region. \nHowever, despite its more secure position, e0f35f2d3d844f15 still lay in a contested region, and it changed hands several times during this period. A Byzantine offensive in 837, led by the emperor Theophilos, captured e0f35f2d3d844f15 along with Melitene. By autumn 938, the city was back under Arab control - the Hamdanid amir Sayf al-Dawla retreated toward e0f35f2d3d844f15 that autumn while being pursued by Byzantine forces. In 939, according to James Howard-Johnston, e0f35f2d3d844f15 fell to the Byzantines again.\nAfter the Byzantine conquest, e0f35f2d3d844f15 was made the capital of a small theme. This theme probably only covered the immediately surrounding plains to the north and east; i.e. the easternmost part of Anzitene. In the 970s, the theme of e0f35f2d3d844f15 was broken up. e0f35f2d3d844f15 shrank to a medium-sized town and some of its population probably migrated to Harput, the new main capital of the region. A garrison was still kept at e0f35f2d3d844f15's citadel, but the town walls were probably now too big for the dwindling settlement within and must have fallen into disuse. \ne0f35f2d3d844f15 still existed under the Artukid principality of Harput, but it was no longer a major city. It survived until at least 1199, when its bishopric is last attested, and probably continued into the early 13th century as well. When Yaqut al-Hamawi visited e0f35f2d3d844f15 in the early 13th century, he found it \"in ruins, with only a tiny population\". The citadel garrison was eventually withdrawn at some point, possibly after the Seljuk conquest of Anzitene in 1234, and e0f35f2d3d844f15 was finally abandoned. Its population dispersed to villages on the surrounding plain and in the hills beyond.\nThe name \"e0f35f2d3d844f15\" continued to be used until modern times, to denote a group of several villages near where the old city had once stood. As of the 20th century, there were seven of them, collectively known as \"Arşimşat\" (from the Arabic form of the city's name). The closest one to the old city was Haraba (from Arabic \"kharaba\", meaning \"ruin\"), about half a kilometer to the southwest of the ruins. A local tradition recorded around the turn of the 20th century held that there had once been a large city here, divided into two parts called \"Samusat\" and \"Ashmushat\".\nEven before the construction of the Keban Dam, the city ruins (below the citadel) were already underwater due to meandering of the Murat Su, and by the mid-20th century not much of them remained visible, although one traveler reported seeing some khachkars here. Archaeologists conducted excavations at the citadel before the dam was built, in 1969, 1970, and 1973. They dug six trenches, mostly on the southeast side of the hill where walls were already visible.\nBishopric.\ne0f35f2d3d844f15 was historically the seat of a Syriac Orthodox bishop which was responsible for the entire surrounding district of Anzitene. Its last mention is in 1199.\nNo longer a residential bishopric, ",

In it, each player takes the role of a particular alien species, each with a unique power to bend or break one of the rules of the game, trying to establish control over the universe. The game was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\"f377ee3b07b21ca9\" is a dynamic and social game, with players being encouraged to interact, argue, form alliances, make deals, double-cross, and occasionally work together to protect the common good. Most editions of the game are designed for three to five players, although official rules exist for playing with as many as eight players.\nGameplay.\nBasic rules.\n\"f377ee3b07b21ca9\" is based on a fixed set of rules which are subsequently modified by other elements of the game.\nEach player begins with a color-coded \"home system\" containing five planets, and twenty ships (formerly referred to as \"tokens\") representing starships that populate these planets as \"colonies\" (formerly known as \"bases\"). A central \"warp\" is used to place defeated ships for all players. The object of the game is to establish colonies on five planets outside one's home system. Each player is dealt a hand of cards from the \"cosmic deck,\" which includes several types of cards: Attack cards with numbered values, Negotiate (formerly Compromise) cards, Reinforcement cards, and Artifact (formerly Edict) cards.\nThe turn player is referred to as the \"offense.\" On a player's turn, they retrieve one ship from the warp, and then draw a card from the \"Destiny\" deck, containing color-coded cards which indicate which player they must have an encounter with; that player becomes the \"defense.\" Using a special \"hyperspace gate\" (formerly \"hyperspace cone\" or simply \"cone\") indicator, the offense selects the planet at which the encounter will take place, and then places 1 to 4 of their ships on the gate; the defense simply defends with however many ships he has on the targeted planet. Both the offense and defense can then ask the other players individually to ally with their side; each invited player may commit up to 4 ships to either side of the conflict.\nOnce allies have committed, the offense and defense both select encounter cards from their hands to place face-down, then reveal them and play out the encounter based on the types of cards they used.\nAt the end of the offense's turn, they may have a second encounter if they won an attack or made a deal. If they can't, choose not to, or have already had two encounters this turn, then play proceeds to the next player.\nAlien powers.\nThe rules become more complex with the introduction of alien powers. These are typically drawn randomly at the start of the game and known to all players; however, variants exist where players can select their powers, use multiple powers simultaneously, or hide their powers until they are used. Each power gives the player a way to bend the core rules to their advantages, typically in one of the following ways:\nA player's alien power is only active if they have three or more colonies in their home system, and if lost, can be regained by taking back a third colony.\nThe current edition of \"f377ee3b07b21ca9\", published by Fantasy Flight Games, includes a total of 238 aliens across all of its expansion and promo sets. In addition, many players have created their own \"homemade\" powers, and have posted these along with other various game extensions on the Internet.\nVariants.\nMore advanced optional game components can add further levels of complexity and unpredictability. Various editions have included varying numbers of these optional components. They include:\nHistory.\nThe original version of \"f377ee3b07b21ca9\" had exactly six alien powers and was designed for up to six players. This edition was nearly published by Parker Brothers in the mid-1970s; when it was not, the designers founded Eon Productions, Inc. to publish it.\nThe first Eon edition was released in 1977. It allowed up to four players and included fifteen alien powers. Over the next five years, Eon released nine expansions, adding sixty more alien powers, components for a fifth and sixth player, and several new types of pieces, including \"Flare\" cards, money (Lucre), Moons, and special power planet systems. The artwork on these early editions included images painted by Dean Morrissey. Eon published three versions of the base game, differing only in box size and cover art.\nIn 1986, the game was republished in the U.S. by West End Games. The game used the same deck of cards and number of players, and the same powers with five additional powers from Eon expansion sets #1 and #2. However, the cards and tokens were incompatible with the Eon edition. Meanwhile, in the UK, the game was published by Games Workshop. The GW edition supported six players, with powers from the Eon base set and some of the first three expansions.\nIn 1991, the game was licensed by Mayfair Games. Mayfair published \"f377ee3b07b21ca9,\" an expansion called \"More f377ee3b07b21ca9\" (1992), and a stripped-down introductory version of the game called \"Simply Cosmic\" (1995). The Mayfair edition revised some powers from the original Eon set, introduced many more, and significantly revised some of the existing components. It also introduced several new components. By combining the three Mayfair products, it is possible to play a 10-player game.\nIn 2000, Avalon Hill (by then a division of Hasbro) published a simplified version in one box with plastic pieces. While the production quality was high, this version was limited to 20 powers and four players and received no expansions.\nOn August 17, 2007, Fantasy Flight Games announced plans to reprint the game in 2008. Game designer Kevin Wilson gave demonstrations of Fantasy Flight's f377ee3b07b21ca9 version at Gen Con 2008, and the game was released in December. This edition included 50 aliens, flare cards, a new Technology variant, and support for 5 players. Since 2008, Fantasy Flight has released seven expansion sets:\nEach set of aliens includes those aliens' alien sheets and flare cards, along with any special tokens certain aliens may need. An extra player includes 20 ships, 5 planets, a colony marker, and destiny cards of the corresponding color.\nIn 2018, a special 42nd-anniversary edition was released by Fantasy Flight, with new box art, translucent ships, a new alien (the Demon), and a few other minor features. The new edition is still compatible with Fantasy Flight's expansions.\nIn 2022, Fantasy Flight published the seventh expansion for the game: Cosmic Odyssey, designed by Jack Reda, which adds a campaign mode, expands on variant from the previous expansions, and includes several new variants (some of which are reimagined versions of variants from previous editions). \nA standalone two-player adaptation of the game was released in 2020. Titled \"f377ee3b07b21ca9 Duel\", it still features a race to colonize five planets through attacks and negotiations. However, it replaces the standard game's multiplayer alliance system with virtual allies called Envoys, and increases the degree of hidden information in an encounter through methods such as giving the players rotating dials with which to secretly choose their fleet strengths.\nOnline version.\nIn 2003, original designer Peter Olotka and partners launched a new version called \"f377ee3b07b21ca9 Online\" that may be played over the internet. , this version has 35 powers, including four new aliens and two more that are designed for online play (such as Dork, which blocks other players' screens).\n\"f377ee3b07b21ca9 Online\" has since been shut down.

She also won the World Series Hurdle at Punchestown over three miles four times, but was beaten in her attempt at a fifth successive win at the 2014 Festival.\nBackground.\nPedigree.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c was bred by Pierre Rives in France and is owned by the Hammer &amp; Trowel Syndicate. Her sire, Robin des Champs, is a successful National Hunt stallion and a grandson of Mill Reef. He has also sired top chaser Sir Des Champs. Her dam, Vega, is a granddaughter of Prix Ganay winner Carmarthen. She is a 16hh bay mare, not big but “as strong as an ox”.\nEarly career.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c began her career in France in 2007, where she was trained by B. Watrigant. She won her first race in September at Vichy over twelve furlongs, and added a further two victories before being transferred to Ireland and put into training with Champion Trainer Willie Mullins.\nCareer in Ireland.\n2008 season.\nOn her Irish debut in February, dae4c2a27887eb0c won a maiden hurdle race at Punchestown by six lengths under Davy Condon. She reappeared in April to win the Duggan Profiles Novice Hurdle at Gowran Park, this time ridden by Ruby Walsh. She was then stepped up in company and ran in the Grade 1 Punchestown Champion 4YO Hurdle, where she finished ninth to Won In The Dark. She returned to France to run in the Prix Alain du Breil at Auteuil, where she finished third (just behind stablemate and future Champion Hurdler Hurricane Fly) before being put away for the season.\n2009 season.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c did not reappear for eight months before making her belated debut in a two-mile four furlong hurdle race at Punchestown. Sent off the 4/5 favourite, she won easily by four lengths under Ruby Walsh. The following month, she headed to the Cheltenham Festival to run in the newly established David Nicholson Mares’ Hurdle over two and a half miles. Also in the field was the 2008 winner United and Ascot Hurdle winner Chomba Womba. Racing in midfield, dae4c2a27887eb0c made rapid progress from the third last hurdle and stormed up the hill to win impressively by fourteen lengths, giving Walsh his first winner of the week.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c then took on the top two mile hurdlers in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle over two miles, but could only finish third to Grade 1 winner Solwhit and Champion Hurdle victor Punjabi.\nShe was again sent to Auteuil and ran in the Prix la Barka, but could only finish ninth to Portal's Toy and suffered an injury afterwards.\n2010 season.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c did not race again until the Cheltenham Festival the next year, where she again ran in the Mares’ Race. This time she faced Carole's Legacy, a classy mare who regularly faced geldings and Voler La Vedette, who had previously beaten Supreme Novices Hurdle winner Go Native in a Grade 3 race. Although the winning distance was not as far as the previous year, dae4c2a27887eb0c still won with complete authority by over four lengths, after making her move approaching the last flight. Jockey Ruby Walsh described as “a great mare”.\nShe next ran in the Grade 1 World Series Hurdle over three miles at the Punchestown Festival. Under Paul Townend (deputising for the injured Ruby Walsh), she comfortably beat Bensalem and stablemate Mourad by three lengths.\n2011 season.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c once again made her seasonal debut at the Cheltenham Festival when attempting to win a third consecutive Mares Hurdle despite being “a gallop short” according to her trainer. Her sternest opponent was probably Warfield Mares' Hurdle winner Sparky May, but dae4c2a27887eb0c showed she was different class in winning by ten lengths virtually unextended.\nA return to Punchestown saw her win a second World Series Hurdle despite a bad mistake at the last, beating Mourad one and a quarter lengths with Coral Cup winner Carlito Brigante third and Voler La Vedette in fourth.\n2012 season.\ndae4c2a27887eb0c made a bid for a four-timer in the Mares Hurdle off a similar prolonged break as the previous two years, and again was rated a short priced favourite to do so. In the race she quickened to lead approaching the last to beat Kentford Grey Lady by four lengths.\nThis year, the World Series Hurdle saw a clash between dae4c2a27887eb0c and her old rival Voler La Vedette, who had won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle that season and was fresh off an excellent second place to Big Buck's in the World Hurdle at Cheltenham. The race boiled down to a duel between the two mares approaching the straight, but dae4c2a27887eb0c stayed on the best to defeat her opponent by over five lengths, with Mourad once again being placed. Trainer Willie Mullins described her as “a real good mare”.\n2013 season.\nAfter reigning World Hurdler Big Buck's suffered a season-ending injury, there was speculation that dae4c2a27887eb0c might attempt to win that race rather than go for a five-timer in the Mares Hurdle and she was made favourite accordingly. However, Mullins confirmed that the mares’ race was her target and dae4c2a27887eb0c once again lined up on the back of a long absence and as an odds on favourite. Also in the field was the Nicky Henderson trained Une Artiste, who had won the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle the previous year.

It was designed by William David Fenwick and built in 1912 by William Henry Bytheway. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000.\nHistory.\nThe 5316fb9495c2d40d, the second to be built on the site, was constructed in 1912 by W Bytheway, a builder from Gympie. At the time, Eumundi was one of a number of small but prosperous Sunshine Coast hinterland towns servicing a timber, dairy and pastoral industry.\nThe first selector in the North Maroochy River district, Joseph Gridley, arrived at Moreton Bay in 1856 on the James Fernie with his wife Ellen and five children. In 1877, Gridley selected Portion 70, where the Hall now stands, for timber getting.\nIn 1886 the Queensland Government proposed a township at Eumundi as a station on the railway line between Brisbane and Maryborough. Residential land was auctioned in 1890 and the rail line was opened in 1891. The rail stop serviced the Eumundi timber getting area where selectors, including the Gridleys, had selected land during the 1870s. By 1893 a local provisional school was operating. Dairy farmers started arriving in the area during the 1900s, either by overlanding their stock or accompanying them north on the railway.\nIn May 1905, the County of Canning, Parish of Maroochy, Town of Eumundi allocated Reserve Land Allotment 5, Section 2 for the hall by Proclamation. The allotment to be set apart was \"situated opposite the most southerly gate of the Eumundi railway station yards upon a ridge...The site is a fine one for building purposes, and in every way suitable for a public building. The Association propose to build a Hall by subscription to be used for public meetings and associations\". A single-storey timber hall was constructed by Peter Denholm on the site in 1908.\nAfter only four years however, the burgeoning community needed more space and Gympie builder, W Bytheway, built a second hall in beech timber and iron roof on the same site, replacing the first Hall. It can \"best be described as a big Hall with stage at back, and a couple of anterooms at the front, having a library, wide passage, and reading room under the front, and supper room under the centre\". The Hall was officially opened on 15 November 1912 when \"The programme included a two days bazaar... the whole to be started by the official opening of the splendid new building... A first glance was permitted... to the party accompanying the Honourable JW Blair, Minister of Education. The building was planned by W Fenwick of Cooroy\". The hall was constructed at a cost of .\nAccording to social commentator, AH Corrie, writing in the Nambour Chronicle in January 1919, Eumundi was quite prosperous with two hotels, two stores, three churches, a large public hall, library and billiard table. He believed Eumundi's School of Arts was one of the \"largest and best appointed buildings of its kind on the North Coast Line between Brisbane suburbs and Gympie\".\nReconstruction was considered essential when the School of Arts was damaged by termites, worsening by 1931. By 1950, the Hall was condemned and a ball was cancelled. In 1953, the building was restumped with cement blocks, however, more termite damage occurred during 1964 at the rear of the building. Tenders were called in 1964 for the lowering of the Hall which was \"in bad repair and is so high is costly to renovate\". The damage was so advanced that in 1968 the lower level was removed to save the rest of the building and the twin-spitter front steps were replaced by single steps. At this time, the Eerwah Vale Hall and stumps were incorporated into Eumundi's hall.\nThe Government increased the School of Arts Reserve to include Allotments 6 and 7 in 1967 to allow for parking spaces. The Eumundi &amp; District Historical Association (E&amp;DHA) was appointed as School of Arts Trustees in 1989. The School of Arts is still the focus for many of Eumundi's social and cultural activities.\nDescription.\n5316fb9495c2d40d is situated on a treed ridge on the lower side of Memorial Drive. The single-storey, timber building with gabled, corrugated iron roof, sits on concrete stumps. Externally, the building is clad with chamferboard, with the exception of weatherboards at the rear of the building. Also at the rear of the hall is a pair of double doors and smaller door at the back of the stage, covered by tin The front, or eastern facade, has an asymmetrical veranda with timber posts and brackets. The decorative bargeboard and finial have been removed and covered with chamferboards, however, the circular, ventilated opening remains. The porch ceiling is of tongue and groove boards, the remainder is unlined. Leading onto the veranda are two doors either side, which lead to storage areas, and a central, panelled timber door.\nInternally, in the storage room located at the southern end of the building is a set of stairs which lead to the projection room. From this room, a door leads to the 1968 addition. This area now houses a kitchen. Both two storage rooms located at the front of the hall still have extant viewing slots. In the 1960s, these slots were used by the ticket collectors to watch the movies.\nThe main hall is rectangular with crows ash flooring. It is divided by the support beams of the addition to its southern side. The main hall has two raked timber ceilings with latticed air vents (one partially obscured) and six large, sashed windows which open top and bottom, on its northern wall. Four louvered airvents (windows) have been recently installed at floor level below the original windows. A trapdoor to the right hand side of the stage was used to access the lower floor pre-1968. A single door, located near the stage, allows southern external access.\nOn the eastern side, the main hall area has a half-timbered VJ wall and a fibro upper to the ceiling. The remainder of the hall is VJ lined. Two inside doors were sealed , one near the old RSL door located at the front of the building and another on the other side of the main entrance door. The stage is accessed by two wooden steps. Vertical timberwork now fronts the top of the stage, partly concealing one of the latticed air vents in the roof. A small, heavily latticed bar (formed by enclosing the rear of the addition) with a pulldown hatch and lockable door is accessed on the left prior to ascending the steps to toilet facilities at the southern end of the building. The southern wall of the hall's addition has six window openings.\nEmergency exit doors, and sidesteps leading down from the kitchen door's southern landing, access the carpark in Pacey Street. Part of the slope at the hall's rear was excavated to provide building access and space. Several macadamised parking spaces abut its southern side, extending to a secondary side road.\nHeritage listing.\n5316fb9495c2d40d was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nThe 5316fb9495c2d40d is important in demonstrating the pattern and evolution of Queensland's history, being an important component of the cultural life of the Eumundi community as a school of arts and public library.

The franchise is also known for launching the careers of previously unknown artists, including Joseline Hernandez, K. Michelle and Cardi B.\nThe franchise has generated controversy since its inception, and is often criticized for tending towards a narrative format more commonly seen in scripted genres such as soap operas, and appearing to fabricate much of its story line. However, it is one of the highest rated unscripted franchises in cable television history, and has been described as a \"guilty pleasure\".\nThe show aired continuously from May 5, 2014 until May 11, 2020, with an incarnation of the franchise airing nearly every Monday on VH1. In the US, ' usually aired in spring and through summer, followed by ' in the fall and ' and ' in the winter.

Jim Ackerman, senior vice president of development and production at the time, paired him with producers Stefan Springman and Toby Barraud of NFGTV, who produced the 11-minute presentation tape \"Keeping Up with the Joneses\", which also featured Jones' longtime girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin and his mother Nancy. VH1 were unsure if audiences would be invested in the concept full-time and Jones' manager, Yandy Smith, approached Mona Scott-Young, her former employer at Violator, to retool the show. The concept was tweaked to include Jim's girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin and her circle of friends, influenced by the female ensemble-driven reality shows of the time.\nThe series was first announced in VH1's programming development report in April 2010, under the title \"Diary of a Hip Hop Girlfriend\".\nOn January 4, 2011, VH1 announced that \"50dc176f293c7453\" would debut on March 6, 2011.

Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" praised the show's deconstruction of the public image of rappers, as well as the quality of the production values with \"slick, beautiful shots of the women driving spectacular cars with no men in sight\". However, he was critical of the \"needless filler drama\", a criticism that was shared by other critics who felt the \"endless catty arguments and trashy behavior\" detracted from the show's message and was too derivative of \"The Real Housewives\" franchise.\nBreakthrough (2011–14).\nOn May 25, 2011, \"50dc176f293c7453\" was renewed for a second season, which premiered on November 14, 2011.

The Royal Mail postcode begins LL61 with a community population taken at the 2011 census of 465. \nEdward Greenly gave the name of the village to the Monian ‘cdbb3469cc4d36ec Zone of Metamorphism', a Precambrian blueschist terrane stretching along the hill from Red Wharf Bay to Newborough; the blueschist event has been dated to about 550 million years ago. \nWhen Welsh nobleman Rhys ap Tudur was executed in 1412, lands of the cdbb3469cc4d36ec family were forfeited. The village is notable for its early 17th century almshouses. The bwthyn at Minffordd was the first place on Anglesey used for Nonconformist worship in the early 18th century.

The film stars Michael Douglas as President Andrew Shepherd, a widower who pursues a relationship with environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) – who has just moved to Washington, D.C. – while at the same time attempting to win the passage of a crime control bill during a re-election year. Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox and Richard Dreyfuss star in supporting roles.\n\"806bd3cc24ffcc58\" grossed $107.9 million on a budget of $62 million, and was praised by critics for its performances (especially of Douglas and Bening), musical score, story, and screenplay. Composer Marc Shaiman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score for \"806bd3cc24ffcc58\". The film was nominated for Golden Globes for Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical for Michael Douglas, Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical for Annette Bening, and Best Comedy/Musical. The American Film Institute ranked \"806bd3cc24ffcc58\" No. 75 on its list of America's Greatest Love Stories.\nPlot.\nPopular Democratic President Andrew Shepherd prepares to run for re-election. The president and his staff, led by Chief of Staff and best friend AJ MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill. However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives reject it, and liberals think it is too weak. If passed, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed to be guaranteed. Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and have the Congressional support to pass it, by his State of the Union Address.\nWhen the unmarried President's cousin, Judith, is sick and unable to act as hostess at a state dinner for the French president, Shepherd realizes his staff's public portrayal of him as lonely widower is true. Soon after, Shepherd meets and is attracted to Sydney Ellen Wade, a lawyer employed by an environmental lobbying firm that is working to pass legislation to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions. During a meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill before his State of the Union Address, he will deliver the last 10 votes. MacInerney believes Wade will fail to obtain enough votes, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.\nShepherd and Wade begin seeing each other and fall in love. Presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson steps up his attacks, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and family values. The President's refusal to refute Rumson's aspersions lowers his approval ratings and erodes crucial political support that threatens the crime bill.\nWade is dejected after her failed meeting with three Michigan congressmen to discuss the environmental bill. When she tells Shepherd about the meeting, she inadvertently mentions that the congressmen want to defeat both the President's crime bill and Wade's environmental bill. Shepherd and A.J. are conflicted about how they obtained this sensitive information, but are unable to ignore the opportunity to pass the crime bill, even if it means the president going back on his deal with Wade.\nEventually, Wade secures enough votes for the environmental bill while Shepherd is three short. He can only obtain them by shelving the environmental bill to solidify the three Michigan congressmen's votes for the crime bill which he agrees to do. Wade's firm fires her for failing to achieve their objectives and for seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation. She goes to see Shepherd to end their relationship and says she has a job opportunity in Hartford, Connecticut. While he defends the crime bill as his top priority, she criticizes it as weakly worded with little chance of preventing crime.\nPrior to the State of the Union Address, Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebukes Rumson's attacks on his values and character, as well as his relentless innuendos that Wade prostituted herself for political favors. He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuelsfar more than the 10% originally proposed. Furthermore, he is withdrawing the crime bill for a stronger one with significant gun control measures. His passion galvanizes the press and his staff. Shepherd and Wade reconcile, then she walks him to the doors of the House chamber where he enters to thunderous applause as he is about to deliver the State of the Union Address.\nProduction.\nOriginally, actor Robert Redford approached a number of screenwriters with the single-line premise, \"the president elopes\". Sorkin, on the basis of his treatment, was selected by Redford to write the screenplay with Redford attached to star. Emma Thompson turned down the role of Sydney Wade. When Reiner was brought aboard to direct, Redford dropped out. At the time, in October 1994, with cameras set to roll on November 30 of that year, Redford's publicist attributed his decision to his desire \"to do a love story, but (Reiner) wanted to do something that was ultimately about politics\". Other sources suggested that Redford and Reiner \"didn't get along...It was a personality thing.\"\nIn later interviews, writer Aaron Sorkin told \"TV Guide\" he wrote the screenplay while high on crack cocaine while he was living at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, which is why it took him three years to complete it.\nAn extensive White House set, of both the East and West Wings, was built on the Castle Rock Entertainment lot in Culver City. The set's Oval Office was later reused for the films \"Nixon\" and \"Independence Day.\"\nLawsuit.\nWilliam Richert sued the Writers Guild of America over not being credited on the screenplay of the film. Richert claimed Sorkin's screenplay was a thinly veiled plagiarism of Richert's 1981 screenplay \"The President Elopes\". After Guild arbitration, Sorkin was awarded full credit on \"806bd3cc24ffcc58\". Richert also claimed that the television series \"The West Wing\" was derived from part of the same screenplay.\nRelease.\n\"806bd3cc24ffcc58\" grossed $60.1 million in the United States, and $47.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $107.9 million.\nThe film grossed $10 million in its opening weekend (finishing third), $9.7 million in its second weekend, and $5.3 million in its third (finishing sixth both times).\nReception.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A charming romantic comedy with political bite, Rob Reiner's \"806bd3cc24ffcc58\" features strong lead performances and some poignant observations of politics and media in the 1990s.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nIt received praise and \"Two Thumbs Up\" from Siskel and Ebert who were surprised by how good the film was considering Rob Reiner's previous film, \"North\", was both of their selections for the worst movie of the year. Ebert said after detesting \"North\" he was very happy and pleased to give Reiner's next film a unanimously positive review. Siskel praised Douglas and Bening for their performances.\nLegacy.\nInfluence on \"The West Wing\".\nThe screenplay for the film inspired many aspects of Sorkin's later television drama \"The West Wing\". The two productions follow the staff of a largely idealized White House, and like many of Sorkin's projects, share ideologies.\nThe film's influence can be seen most clearly in early episodes of the series; some dialogue in the two are nearly identical. Sorkin has been known to say that much of the first season was actually taken from material he edited out of the first draft of \"",

        "content": "8471cb43eec5e078 (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese rock band formed in Hakodate in 1988. The core four members, vocalist Teru, guitarists Takuro and Hisashi, and bassist Jiro, have been together since 1992. Primarily composing songs in the rock and pop genres, they have also arranged songs using elements from a variety of other genres, including progressive rock, punk, electronic, R&amp;B, folk, gospel, reggae, and ska. Originally a visual kei band, the group slowly shifted to less dramatic attire through the years. With five million copies sold, 8471cb43eec5e078's 1997 compilation album \"Review\" is the fifth best-selling album of all time in Japan. Their July 1999 concert at Makuhari Messe was attended by 200,000 people, making it the largest-ticketed concert ever held by a single act at the time. As of 2008, 8471cb43eec5e078 had sold an estimated 51 million records; 28 million singles and 23 million albums, making them one of the top ten best-selling artists of all time in Japan.\nHistory.\n1988–1994: Indies era.\n8471cb43eec5e078 formed in 1988 as a high school band when Takuro asked Teru, a schoolmate, to play the drums. They found a bassist but had difficulty finding a vocalist. When Teru made a tape of his singing and gave it to Takuro he was immediately recruited for the part, leaving the drums part to be filled by another person. On the search for a second guitarist, Hisashi was asked to join but declined the offer, as he was already part of a locally well-known heavy punk/rock band called Ari, which better suited his taste in music. Hisashi eventually accepted Takuro's offer and became 8471cb43eec5e078's lead guitarist after Ari disbanded in 1989. Officially, the name \"8471cb43eec5e078\" was coined by Takuro and is a deliberate misspelling of the word \"gray\" to represent the style of music they wanted to play: a mixture between rock (black) and pop (white). However, Hisashi confirmed in an interview with \"Natalie\" that the name came from Jun Gray, a member of the punk rock band Kenzi &amp; The Trips that he and Takuro had read about in the magazine \"Takarajima\".\nBy the time of Takuro and Teru's graduation, 8471cb43eec5e078 were enjoying some popularity in their hometown of Hakodate and were playing full live houses. Following Hisashi's high school graduation in 1990, the three moved to Tokyo to try to further expand their musical career. The bassist and the drummer chose to stay in Hakodate. In Tokyo, they found a completely different situation: although they had been relatively popular in their hometown, it was not easy to begin a career in Tokyo. Their concerts attracted few people, and sometimes none at all, and many live houses would not accept them because they did not fit well into either rock or pop categories. The band had to conciliate their music career to part-time jobs, and faced financial problems during their first years in Tokyo.\nDuring this time, members (particularly drummers) were constantly joining and leaving the band. When their bassist quit, Takuro knew that Jiro, who was also from Hakodate and had played with the indie band Pierrot (different from the now disbanded Pierrot, that enjoyed mainstream popularity), had moved to Tokyo and invited him to join 8471cb43eec5e078. He too, declined the offer, insisting that he was already heading in the right direction for himself. It wasn't until Takuro asked him to play at just one show to fill in for their missing bassist that he decided to go. Following that show, Jiro continued to receive invitations to play with 8471cb43eec5e078, and eventually he became 8471cb43eec5e078's official bass player, finalizing the official four member lineup in August 1992.\nThey promoted the band by handing out flyers on the street and giving out demo tapes. Eventually they became better known on the Tokyo live house circuit, and began drawing larger crowds. Eventually, hide of X Japan gave one of 8471cb43eec5e078's demos to his bandmate Yoshiki. During an October 1993 show, Yoshiki and his entourage came to watch and offered the band a contract to his record label Extasy Records. Their debut single, \"Rain\", and their first album, \"Hai to Diamond\", were both released on May 25, 1994.\n1995–2000: Record-setting success.\nAfter the time of their debut, 8471cb43eec5e078 steadily became more popular. Their 4th single \"Freeze My Love\" made it onto the Oricon Top 20, debuting at No. 19. Two months later their second album, \"Speed Pop\", peaked at No. 8. It was their first album released on Platinum Records, a division of PolyGram that Yoshiki founded that same year. Their first No. 1 hit was in 1996 with their third album \"Beat Out!\", which was marked as a major turning point in 8471cb43eec5e078's career. Released later that same year, the fourth album \"Beloved\" was their first album to sell over 1 million copies. In September 1996, 8471cb43eec5e078 played the final concert of the Beat Out! Reprise Tour at Nippon Budokan, their first concert at the venue, which is stated by them to have been their biggest dream coming true. In August 1997, their 12th single \"However\" remained at the top of the charts for two weeks in a row and, after it was displaced by Zard's single \"Eien\" for one week, it re-appeared at the top position for another three weeks.\nIn the period between 1997 and 2000, 8471cb43eec5e078 produced six million-selling singles, being the third artist with most million-selling singles of all time. Their 13th single \"Yuuwaku\" topped Oricon yearly single ranking in 1998. In 1999, their 16th single \"Winter, Again\" was number two of the year and won the 41st Japan Record Awards \"Grand Prix\" award, which is considered the most important Japanese music award. Their albums were also massively successful; both \"Pure Soul\" (1998) and \"Heavy Gauge\" (1999), along with the compilation album \"\" (2000), sold more than two million copies each.\nThe impact of their popularity was such that, in 1998, Japan's telephone service was temporarily put out of order due to the mass number of fans trying to reserve tickets to their upcoming tour. The 1998 Winter Olympics were being held, and press coverage of the event became chaotic because of the incident.\nIn this period, the band won several prizes and established records. In 1997, their compilation album \"Review - Best of 8471cb43eec5e078\" stayed for five weeks in a row at the top position of the Oricon chart and became the all-time best-selling album in Japan at the time, with almost 5 million copies sold. Their 1999 video \"Survival\" sold approximately 900,000 copies, and is the all-time best-selling video/DVD. In the same year, their first \"Expo\" concert would lure a record audience of 200,000 people (see \"8471cb43eec5e078 Expos\" below).\n1999 was the year 8471cb43eec5e078 played their first dome tour, 8471cb43eec5e078 Dome Tour \"pure soul\" 1999, which made the band the first to hold a consecutive 5 day \"dome\" concert. This tour had a total of 15 performances in four venues and attracted a total audience of 750,000 people. 8471cb43eec5e078 closed the year of 1999, playing the concert The Millennium Eve - A Christmas Present for the People Who Love Live a Lot, a joint concert with Luna Sea, on December 23, and the 8471cb43eec5e078 Countdown Live in Messe \"Come Together\" concert on December 31.\nTakuro described the \"Expo'99\" as a dream come true. When the album \"Heavy Gauge\" was released, in October 1999, Takuro wrote a diary entry in 8471cb43eec5e078's official home page, describing the album as a representation of his feelings at that moment. His feelings were not of happiness, but of \"emptiness\" and not knowing what to do after \"doing everything\" they wanted to. The album is seen as a first step to a new direction in the band's career. The band considered disbanding in 2000, after releasing their , which was a suggestion made by fellow singer Yuki Isoya, whose group Judy and Mary had disbanded.\n2001–2003.\nAfter this period of massive success and a considerably steady style in their music, ",

Besides passwords those applications can offer storage other often used sensitive data like credit card data for payment and frequent flyer information.\n16fa59aed697a832s typically require a user to generate and remember one \"master\" password to unlock and access information stored in their databases. 16fa59aed697a832s can also integrate multi-factor authentication and utilize in-device biometrics like Face ID or Touch ID.\nDedicated password managers have existed since the mid to late 1990s. Web Confidential was probably one of the first programs to facilitate password management, when it first surfaced in 1998. All major browsers added this feature in the early 2000s. \nLocally installed software.\n16fa59aed697a832s commonly reside on the user's device: computer or mobile device as a locally installed application or/and as a browser extension. These applications can be offline, wherein the password database is stored independently and locally on the same device as the password manager software. Alternatively, password managers may offer or require a cloud-based approach, wherein the password database is dependent on an online file hosting service and stored remotely, but handled by password management software installed on the user's device.\nSome offline password managers do not require Internet permission, so there is no leakage of data due to the network. To some extent, a fully offline password manager is more secure, but may be much weaker in convenience and functionality than an online one.\nWeb-based services.\nAn online password manager is a website that securely stores login details. They are a web-based version of more conventional desktop-based password manager.\nThe advantages of online password managers over desktop-based versions are portability (they can generally be used on any computer with a web browser and a network connection, without having to install software), and a reduced risk of losing passwords through theft from or damage to a single PC – although the same risk is present for the server that is used to store the users passwords on. In both cases this risk can be prevented by ensuring secure backups are taken.\nThe major disadvantages of online password managers are the requirements that the user trusts the hosting site and that there is no keylogger on the computer they are using. With servers and the cloud being a focus of cyber attacks, how one authenticates into the online service and whether the passwords stored there are encrypted with a user defined key are just as important. Another important factor is whether one- or two-way encryption is used.\nSome online password management systems, such as Bitwarden, are open source, where the source code can be independently audited, or hosted on a user's own machine, rather than relying on the service's cloud.\nThe use of a web-based password manager is an alternative to single sign-on techniques, such as OpenID or Microsoft's Microsoft account (previously Microsoft Wallet, Microsoft Passport, .NET Passport, Microsoft Passport Network, and Windows Live ID) scheme, or may serve as a stop-gap measure pending adoption of a better method.\nAdvantages.\nThe advantage of password-based access controls is that they are easily incorporated in most software using APIs available in many software products, they require no extensive computer/server modifications, and that users are already familiar with the use of passwords. While passwords can be fairly secure, the weakness is how users choose and manage them, by using:\nIt is typical to make at least one of these mistakes. This makes it very easy for hackers, crackers, malware and cyber thieves to break into individual accounts, corporations of all sizes, government agencies, institutions, etc. It is protecting against these vulnerabilities that makes password managers so important.\n16fa59aed697a832s can also be used as a defense against phishing and pharming. Unlike human beings, a password manager program can also incorporate an automated login script that first compares the current site's URL to the stored site's URL. If the two do not match then the password manager does not automatically fill in the login fields. This is intended as a safeguard against visual imitations and look-alike websites. With this built-in advantage, the use of a password manager is beneficial even if the user only has a few passwords to remember. While not all password managers can automatically handle the more complex login procedures imposed by many banking websites, many of the newer password managers handle complex passwords, multi-page fill-ins, and multi-factor authentication prior.\nBy that same logic, password managers can also protect against keystroke logging malware (keyloggers). When using a multi-factor authentication password manager that automatically fills in logon fields, the user does not have to type any user names or passwords for the keylogger to pick up. While a keylogger may pick up the PIN to authenticate into the smart card token, for example, without the smart card itself (something the user has) the PIN does the attacker no good. However, password managers cannot protect against man-in-the-browser attacks, where malware on the user's device performs operations (e.g. on a banking website) while the user is logged in while hiding the malicious activity from the user.\nIssues.\nVulnerabilities.\nIf the passwords are stored in an unencrypted fashion, it is still generally possible to obtain the passwords given local access to the machine.\nSome password managers use a user-selected master password or passphrase to form the key used to encrypt the protected passwords. The security of this approach depends on the strength of the chosen password (which might be guessed or brute-forced), and also that the passphrase itself is never stored locally where a malicious program or individual could read it. A compromised master password renders all of the protected passwords vulnerable.\nAs with any system which involves the user entering a password, the master password may also be attacked and discovered using key logging or acoustic cryptanalysis. Some password managers attempt to use virtual keyboards to reduce this risk – though this is still vulnerable to key loggers that take screenshots as data is entered. This risk can be mitigated with the use of a multi-factor verification device.\nSome password managers include a password generator. Generated passwords may be guessable if the password manager uses a weak random number generator instead of a cryptographically secure one.\nA strong password manager will include a limited number of false authentication entries allowed before the password manager is locked down and requires IT services to re-activate. This is the best way to protect against the brute-force attack.\n",

The island has a population of less than 118 full-time residents and has an area of less than . 5f8246012c5d9435 is inhabited by a small Bahamian village which lies on the western shore. The village is composed of residential housing, a few restaurants, a church, a police station, post office, a library, three small retail stores and marine supply shops. 5f8246012c5d9435 is protected by the Bahamas National Trust, the organization in charge of the conservation and preservation of places of historic interest and natural beauty in The Bahamas.\nHistory.\n5f8246012c5d9435 was established in 1783 when the American loyalist settled the entire archipelago of Exuma.\nThe island gained its popularity with the establishment of The 5f8246012c5d9435 Yacht Club in 1956, founded by Bob Chamberlain and Joe Hocher. A variety of businesses operate on 5f8246012c5d9435 to provide accommodation and organize activities.\n\"Thunderball Grotto\", a limestone cave situated on the western coast of Staniel cay, was the setting of the 1965 \"James Bond\" film \"Thunderball\". It was from this film the name Thunderball was given to the grotto. The island was also used as a filming location for a scene in the 1983 James Bond film \"Never Say Never Again\". 5f8246012c5d9435 has a small airport called 5f8246012c5d9435 Airport, which makes the island reachable both by sea and air. The airport closed for seven months in 2015 for runway repairs and reopened to air traffic on 18 November 2015.\nLanguage.\nThe official language of 5f8246012c5d9435 is English, but dialects exist among the different islands and Cays. A blend of African, English, and island dialects makes up the Bahamian English language. The idiom on the island was influenced by the African slaves and other settlers.\nPhysical geography.\n5f8246012c5d9435 is located near the center of Exuma Cays. The island, located between Big Major Cay and Bitter Guana Cay, is one of the larger islands within the Exuma Cays. The island is composed of beaches, salt water, and a variety of vegetation. An abundance of coral reef can be found along the shores of 5f8246012c5d9435. It is accessible through scheduled flights, charter airplanes, and private planes, using its 3000-foot airstrip. It is also possible to reach the island by boat providing anchorages for yachts.\nFlora and fauna.\nVegetation includes palm trees, bougainvilleas, hibiscus and seagrape. A diverse range of red, black and white mangrove can also be found on the island. Flora includes sugar cane and tamarind, which are typically served as local dishes. Fauna includes the typical Bahamian Pig and Anolis lizards. In 1977, small groups of brown anole were released in 5f8246012c5d9435, small brown and yellow lizards with black markings on their backs. These small reptiles are 17–20 cm long and usually live in forests. The reptiles feed on the insects around the island.\nThe waters are populated with fish and vegetation of varying sizes including larger fish such as: sharks, groupers, barracuda, angelfish, and butterfly fish, miniature crabs, and daredevil shrimp.\nClimate.\n5f8246012c5d9435 has a tropical savannah climate. In the summer the average air temperature is approximately . In winter the average air temperature is in the mid 20s. Water temperatures are degrees all year long.\nMoreover, cloudy days are often warm and the precipitations are concentrated in the warmest months, which are July, August and September.\nEconomy.\nA large part of 5f8246012c5d9435's economic support is provided by the 5f8246012c5d9435 Yacht Club and The Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park. Initially, Park laws allowed a daily fishery catch quota. In 1986, due to unverifiable pressure on fish, lobster, coral reefs and other marine life, the Trust declared the entire park a “fishery reserve”. Now such areas are promoted as one of the best ways to sustain fishery resources. \n5f8246012c5d9435's economy is based on tourism. Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. The Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park has become an important factor in the economy of the Exuma Cays through tourism, farming, coastal fishing and public education.\nEnvironmental protection.\nSustainable tourism has increased in reputation in recent years, particularly for destinations such as 5f8246012c5d9435. The island relies heavily on its natural attributes, making the most of its reputation as an untouched tropical island. According to the Bahamas National Trust (BNT), 80% of visitors to the Exuma Cays come to experience nature. According to the BNT, 16,665 people visited Thunderball Grotto between November 2012 and April 2013. The area around 5f8246012c5d9435 is managed and protected by the BNT as it falls within the boundary of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park. This park was created in 1958 and stretches 455 km2 in size. The park protects the marine environment and establishes a no-take, marine reserve. In January 2013, the BNT published a report that reviewed current sustainable tourism models which lead to the adoption of the Tourism Optimization Management Model. The model focuses on the interactions tourist have with the environment and how they could be improved. The BNT established a Project Management Group consisting of local stakeholders as well as representatives from the Ministry of Tourism.\nCulture.\n5f8246012c5d9435 has a mixture of different cultural traditions with ancient customs. Due to the level of tourism many festivals are oriented towards entertaining visitors and travellers to the island. Bahamian music ranges in style and includes genres such as Caribbean Reggae and Rake-n-Scrape. Other traditional cultural activities include storytelling.\nOne cultural festival on the island is Junkanoo. It is a festival celebrated on Boxing Day, New Year's Day and other holidays. It is a festival of music, art and dance.\nReligion.\nThe on Cay church with services held during the week and every Sunday is Mount Olivet Baptist Church. About 32% of the population of the Bahamas are Christian and Baptist. 20% belong to Anglican groups and about 24% are Protestants, such as the Methodists (6%), the Church of God (6%), Seventh-day Adventists, and members of the Salvation Army. Roman Catholics constitute 19% of the population. There are also groups of Jews, Baháʼís, Muslims, Hindus, and Rastafarians and a strong Greek Orthodox community. Traditional practices as Voodoo or Obeah are still practiced in some areas.\nVisitor activities.\n5f8246012c5d9435 has a variety of activities and events for tourists and residents to participate in on the island. These include beach activities, snorkeling, scuba diving, fishing, and kayaking. 5f8246012c5d9435 has guided tours, activities, and the well-known swimming pigs.\nSnorkeling.\nMarine life can be explored by participating in a variety of snorkeling activities. There are miles of coral reefs on 5f8246012c5d9435 and neighbouring islands and Cays. The waters surrounding the islands are clear and shallow, making snorkeling easy for first-timers, but a variety of places exist for more experienced divers. Grottos can be found around the island, including Thunderball grotto which is a natural limestone cavern which can be entered underwater or at low tide. Light enters through a vaulted ceiling and a variety of sea-life swim in the water below, including the purple parrotfish, yellowtail snappers, Angelfish and Sergeant Majors. The island is surrounded by shallow reefs within a few feet of the surface. Farther out from the islands, the waters are cluttered with thousands of shallow water sites, coral heads, and reefs.

Founded in 1959 as a successor to an earlier publication, the triannual publication is housed in the Oregon Civic Justice Center. The journal is edited by students of the law school with oversight by the college's faculty. As of 2019, the \"e2c70fe3011b7c92\" has published a total of 55 volumes.\nHistory.\nWillamette University's law school established a publication called the \"Legal Handbooks\" in 1949. In 1959, the school founded their law review journal, replacing the \"Legal Handbooks\". The school's faculty had decided to start the journal and selected the first editorial staff. Ronald B. Lansing served as the first editor in chief of what started as a twice-yearly publication. The first issue focused on employer liability.\nAt the beginning of its existence, the Oregon State Bar helped pay for the publication, with copies sent to all members of the Oregon Bar. The journal was first located in the law school building at what is now Gatke Hall, and moved in 1967 to the new Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center when the law school relocated to its new home. In the early years of the journal, student authors were required to meet certain academic standards. First year students and those in the lower two-thirds of their second and third year class could not submit articles for publication.\nOriginally titled as the Willamette Law Journal for its first 14 volumes, the name was changed to the \"e2c70fe3011b7c92\" in 1978. By Spring 1981, the yearly subscription cost for the journal had risen to USD $12.50. That issue included articles on the use of televisions in courtrooms and piercing the corporate veil among other topics. In October 2006, the journal sponsored a symposium on former Oregon Supreme Court justice and distinguished scholar in residence at Willamette, Hans A. Linde.\nIn September 2008, \"e2c70fe3011b7c92\" moved into the new Oregon Civic Justice Center, located in the former Salem Carnegie Library, along with several other law school programs. The building was rededicated in a ceremony with Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the guest of honor.\nEditions.\nEarly volumes of the publication focused on a single legal issue. Although the periodical is focused on legal issues in general, every other year one edition is focused on purely Oregon legal items. One of these topics was the Oregon Uniform Trust Code when it became law in 2006. According to a draft list published by the \"Albany Law Review\", the \"e2c70fe3011b7c92\" ranks in their tier five (journals in that tier rank 196 to 260 out of 540 total law reviews) of assessment of law journals based on the journal's article selection process.\nThe \"",

        "content": "5db7186b13c944cf is the smaller of two rocky hills south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania—the companion to the adjacent, taller hill named Big Round Top. It was the site of an unsuccessful assault by Confederate troops against the Union left flank on July 2, 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, during the American Civil War.\n5db7186b13c944cf was successfully defended by a brigade under Colonel Strong Vincent, who was mortally wounded during the fighting and died five days later. The 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, fought its most famous engagement there, culminating in a dramatic downhill bayonet charge. The battle at 5db7186b13c944cf subsequently became one of the most well-known actions at Gettysburg, and of the entire war.\nGeography.\n5db7186b13c944cf is a large diabase spur of Big Round Top with an oval crest (despite its name) that forms a short ridgeline with a summit of prominence above the saddle point to Big Round Top to the south. It is located in Cumberland Township, approximately two miles (3 km) south of Gettysburg, with a rugged, steep slope rising above nearby Plum Run to the west and strewn with large boulders. The summit is a total of above sea level. Historically, the western slope was generally free of vegetation, while the summit and eastern and southern slopes were lightly wooded. Directly to the south is Big Round Top, higher and densely wooded.\nThe igneous landform was created 200 million years ago when the \"outcrop of the Gettysburg sill\" intruded through the Triassic \"Gettysburg plain\". Subsequent periglacial frost wedging during the Pleistocene formed the hill's extensive boulders.\nThere is no evidence that the name \"5db7186b13c944cf\" was used by soldiers or civilians during the battle, although Col. Franklin A. Haskell, writing to his brother on July 16, 1863, calls it so. Although the larger hill was known before the battle as Round Top, Round Top Mountain, and sometimes Round Hill, accounts written in 1863 referred to the smaller hill with a variety of names: Rock Hill, High Knob, Sugar Loaf Hill, Broad Top Summit, and granite spur of Round Top. Historian John B. Bachelder, who had an enormous influence on the preservation of the Gettysburg battlefield, personally favored the name \"Weed's Hill,\" in honor of Brigadier General Stephen H. Weed, who was mortally wounded on 5db7186b13c944cf. Bachelder abandoned that name by 1873. One of the first public uses of \"5db7186b13c944cf\" was by Edward Everett in his oration at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery on November 19, 1863.\nBattle of Gettysburg.\nOn the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, at about 4 PM, Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps began an attack ordered by General Robert E. Lee that was intended to drive northeast up the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of Cemetery Hill, rolling up the Union left flank. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division was assigned to attack up the eastern side of the road, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division the western side. Hood's division stepped off first, but instead of guiding on the road, elements began to swing directly to the east in the direction of the Round Tops. Instead of driving the entire division up the spine of Houck's Ridge (the boulder-strewn area known to the soldiers as the Devil's Den), parts of Hood's division detoured over Round Top and approached the southern slope of 5db7186b13c944cf.\nThere were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the Union III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, General Law, was unaware that Hood had been wounded and he was now in command of the division, so he did not exercise control.\nIn the meantime, 5db7186b13c944cf was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. George Meade, commander of the Army of the Potomac, had ordered Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles' III Corps to defend the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included 5db7186b13c944cf. Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard. This caused a large salient in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den.\nWhen Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles' position. Climbing 5db7186b13c944cf, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including Washington Roebling, to find help from any available units in the vicinity.\nThe response to this request for help came from Maj. Gen. George Sykes, commander of the Union V Corps. Sykes quickly dispatched a messenger to order his 1st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. James Barnes, to 5db7186b13c944cf. Before the messenger could reach Barnes, he encountered Col. Strong Vincent, commander of the 3rd Brigade, who seized the initiative and directed his four regiments to 5db7186b13c944cf without waiting for permission from Barnes. He and Oliver W. Norton, the brigade bugler, galloped ahead to reconnoiter and guide his four regiments into position.\nUpon arrival on 5db7186b13c944cf, Vincent and Norton received fire from Confederate batteries almost immediately. On the western slope, he placed the 16th Michigan, and then proceeding counterclockwise were the 44th New York, the 83rd Pennsylvania, and finally, at the end of the line on the southern slope, the 20th Maine. Arriving only ten minutes before the Confederates, Vincent ordered his brigade to take cover and wait, and he ordered Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine, to hold his position, the extreme left of the Army of the Potomac, at all costs. Chamberlain and his 385 men waited for what was to come.\nBattle of 5db7186b13c944cf.\nThe approaching Confederates were the Alabama Brigade of Hood's Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law. (As the battle progressed and Law realized he was in command of the division, Col. James L. Sheffield was eventually notified to assume brigade command.)

The day was hot and their canteens were empty; Law's order to move out reached them before they could refill their water. Approaching the Union line on the crest of the hill, Law's men were thrown back by the first Union volley and withdrew briefly to regroup. The 15th Alabama, commanded by Col. William C. Oates, repositioned further right and attempted to find the Union left flank.\nThe left flank consisted of the 386 officers and men of the 20th Maine regiment and the 83rd Pennsylvania. Seeing the Confederates shifting around his flank, Chamberlain first stretched his line to the point where his men were in a single-file line, then ordered the southernmost half of his line to swing back during a lull following another Confederate charge. It was there that they \"refused the line\"—formed an angle to the main line in an attempt to prevent the Confederate flanking maneuver. Despite heavy losses, the 20th Maine held through two subsequent charges by the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments for a total of ninety minutes",

Due to drug problems and the law, Rebennack moved to Los Angeles in 1965, joining a group of New Orleans session musicians. Rebennack survived by playing with various pop and rock recording sessions, receiving much of this work with the help of New Orleanian arranger Harold Battiste.\nRebennack desired to make an album that combined the various strains of New Orleans music behind a front man called Dr. John, after a black man named Dr. John Montaine, who claimed to be an African potentate. Rebennack chose this name after hearing about Montaine from his sister, and feeling a \"spiritual kinship\" with him. Rebennack originally wanted New Orleans singer Ronnie Barron to front the band as the Dr. John character, but Don Costa, who managed Barron at the time, advised him against it, claiming it to be a bad career move.

Such tactics can be used for promoting a product or a political candidate. Direct marketing datamining techniques that are used often involve predictive market segmentation (aka cluster analysis). 6c2444e612f5e129's tactics rely on transmitting a tailored message to a subgroup on the basis of unique information about that subgroup.\n6c2444e612f5e129 is increasingly used by political parties and in election campaigns, including Australia, the United States Republican and Democratic political parties, as well as candidates who track individual voters and identify potential supporters. They use various means of communication such as direct mail, phone calls, home visits, television, radio, web advertising, email, and text messaging, among others, to communicate with voters, crafting messages to build support for fundraising, campaign events, volunteering, and eventually to turn them out to the polls on the election day. \n6c2444e612f5e129 can also be used, sometimes by foreign actors, to spread disinformation about political candidates and events among target groups. For example, during the 2016 U.S. election, Russian disinformation campaigns targeted Facebook followers and now-defunct Cambridge Analytica exploited their data. Concerns about the legality and restriction of microtargeting have been raised in both Europe and the United States.\nHistory.\nAlthough some of the tactics of microtargeting had been used in California since 1992, it really started to be used nationally only in 2004. In that year, Karl Rove, along with Blaise Hazelwood at the Republican National Committee, used it to reach voters in 18 states that George W. Bush's reelection campaign was not able to reach by other means. The results were greater contacts with likely Bush voters. For example, in Iowa the campaign was able to reach 92% of eventual Bush voters (compared to 50% in 2000) and in Florida it was able to reach 84% (compared to 50% in 2000). Much of this pioneering work was done by Alex Gage and his firm, TargetPoint Consulting.\nAlso in 2004, Jeff Ballabon, a senior executive at niche content publisher and Internet giant Primedia, Inc., owner of About.com, independently engaged in a form of microtargeting for the Jewish vote. \"According to people familiar with the campaign, he advised the White House on how to reach each of the dozens of distinct Orthodox communities-Syrian and Hungarian, Hasidic and Haredi.\" Ballabon's efforts also succeeded, with The Forward reporting that Ballabon \"basically created a new demographic this election cycle...he helped put his fellow Orthodox Jews on the map as a separate Republican Party constituency. He — or rather, President Bush — was rewarded royally when as many as 80% of Orthodox Jews nationally gave their vote to the GOP ticket.\" \nDemocrats did limited microtargeting in 2004, with some crediting microtargeting for Kerry's win in Iowa in 2004. Some news accounts credited Republican superiority in that area for victories in that election cycle. Democrats later developed microtargeting capabilities for the 2006 election cycle. \"It's no secret that the other side [Republicans] figured this out a little sooner\", said Josh Syrjamaki, director of the Minnesota chapter of America Votes in October 2006. \"They've had four to six years' jump on us on this stuff...but we feel like we can start to catch up.\" In India, firms like EdwardGlobal were first to combine 6c2444e612f5e129 with Geofencing.\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Cambridge Analytica played a role in first promoting Ted Cruz and, eventually, Donald Trump. However, the claims of Cambridge Analytica's influence, made by its managers, have not been proven, and Cruz's opponent Ben Carson was ultimately unsuccessful even though he, too, involved Cambridge Analytica in his campaign.\nMethod.\n6c2444e612f5e129 is a form of targeting that uses recent technological developments to gather large amounts of online data. The data from people's digital footprints is analysed to create and convey messages that reflect an individual's preferences and personality. Research has shown that such digital footprints can be used to accurately and unobtrusively predict psychological traits and states of large groups of people. ",

        "ext_content": " is a modification of a practice used by commercial direct marketers. It would not be possible on a large scale without the development of large and sophisticated databases that contain data about as many voters as possible. The database essentially tracks voter habits in the same ways that companies like Visa track consumer spending habits. The Republican National Committee's database is called Voter Vault. The Democratic National Committee effort is called VoteBuilder. A parallel Democratic effort is being developed by Catalist, a $9 million initiative headed by Harold Ickes, while the leading non-partisan database is offered by Aristotle.\nThe databases contain specific information about a particular voter (party affiliation, frequency of voting, contributions, volunteerism, etc.) with other activities and habits available from commercial data brokers. For instance, the company Cambridge Analytica added the OCEAN psychological profile (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) analysis to other private and public data, and developed the ability to “micro-target” individual consumers or voters with messages most likely to influence their behavior. Such personal information is a \"product\" sold to interested companies. These data are particularly illuminating when portrayed through a geographic information system (GIS), where trends based on location can be mapped alongside dozens or hundreds of other variables. This geographic depiction also makes it ideal for volunteers to visit potential voters (armed with lists in hand, laid out in the shortest route—much like how FedEx and UPS pre-determine delivery routes).\nThese databases are then mined to identify issues important to each voter and whether that voter is more likely to identify with one party or another. As described by Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, their key was to identify people who might be enticed to vote for their client or be discouraged to vote for their opponent. Political information is obviously important here, but consumer preferences can play a role as well. Individual voters are then put into groups on the basis of sophisticated computer modeling. Such groups have names like \"Downscale Union Independents\", \"Tax and Terrorism Moderates,\" and \"Older Suburban Newshounds.\"\nOnce a multitude of voting groups is established according to these criteria and their minute political differences, then the tailored messages can be sent via the appropriate means. While political parties and candidates once prepared a single television advertisement for general broadcast nationwide, it is now not at all uncommon to have several dozen variations on the one message, each with a unique and tailored message for that small demographic sliver of the voting public. This is the same for radio advertisement, direct mail, email, as well as stump speeches and fundraising events",

Along with its three major forks (North Fork, Middle Fork and South Fork), it comprises a major river system that drains much of northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina. The Holston's confluence with the French Broad River at Knoxville marks the beginning of the Tennessee River.\nThe North Fork flows southwest from Sharon Springs in Bland County, Virginia. The Middle Fork flows from near the western border of Wythe County, Virginia, joining the South Fork in Washington County, Virginia, southeast of Abingdon. The South Fork rises near Sugar Grove in Smyth County and flows southwest to join the North Fork at Kingsport. The Watauga River, a tributary of the South Fork Holston, flows westward from Watauga County, North Carolina.\nThe main stem of the Holston is impounded by the Tennessee Valley Authority's Cherokee Dam near Jefferson City, Tennessee. Five other dams, also managed by TVA, impound the Holston's headwater streams: Watauga Dam and Wilbur Dam on the Watauga River, and Boone Dam, Fort Patrick Henry Dam, and South Holston Dam, on the South Fork a86e48b7c5caf304.\nPower generation.\nThe a86e48b7c5caf304 valley has been greatly developed for electrical power generation, both with hydroelectric dams and coal-fired steam plants. In the upper reaches, some of these plants are controlled by private interests; in the downstream portion, they are owned by the United States Government's Tennessee Valley Authority.\nArea.\nAmong the dams and associated reservoirs on the South Fork a86e48b7c5caf304 are Boone Dam and Boone Lake, named for the explorer Daniel Boone; Fort Patrick Henry Dam and Fort Patrick Henry Lake, named for the Revolutionary War hero; and South Holston Dam and South Holston Lake.\nCherokee Dam on the a86e48b7c5caf304 forms Cherokee Lake, named for the historic Native Americans who occupied extensive areas along the a86e48b7c5caf304 at the time of European-American settlement. The United States settlers and army fought with the Cherokee over land in Tennessee, North Carolina, and further South into Georgia and Alabama. In the 1830s the government forced the Cherokee out on the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) west of the Mississippi River, under the authority of the Indian Removal Act passed by Congress in 1830.\nName.\nMaps by early French explorers in this area identified what is now known as the a86e48b7c5caf304 as the \"Cherokee River\", after the tribe they encountered. Early Tennessee historian and Tennessee Supreme Court Justice John Haywood cited in his 1823 book \"The civil and political history of the state of Tennessee from its earliest settlement up to the year 1796, including the boundaries of the state\" that the a86e48b7c5caf304 was identified and named on earlier produced French maps as the \"Cherokee River\".\nBritish colonists later named the a86e48b7c5caf304 after pioneer Stephen Holstein, a European-American settler who built a cabin in 1746 on the upper reaches of the river. Similarly, Holston Mountain was named after the a86e48b7c5caf304.\nRecreation.\nAll three forks in Virginia, South Holston Lake, and the a86e48b7c5caf304 in Tennessee below the South Holston Dam offer relatively easy-to-reach recreation opportunities. The North Fork in Virginia is known as an excellent smallmouth bass river (due to mercury contamination, fish caught in the North Fork of the Holston below Saltville, Virginia must not be consumed). Both the South Fork in Virginia and the first of the Holston in Tennessee below South Holston Dam are quality brown trout and rainbow trout fisheries. The a86e48b7c5caf304 is wide and open enough to allow extensive fly fishing. South Holston Lake offers a variety of fishing opportunity as well, as it contains smallmouth bass, common carp, walleye, pike, sunfish, crappie and a few trout.\nList of crossings.\na86e48b7c5caf304.\nThe following is a list of major road crossings on the a86e48b7c5caf304:\nSouth Fork a86e48b7c5caf304.\nThe following is a list of major road crossings on the South Fork a86e48b7c5caf304:\nMiddle Fork ",

They were known popularly as \"greenbacks\", a name inherited from the earlier greenbacks, the Demand Notes, that they replaced in 1862. Often termed Legal Tender Notes, they were named 452fd2a60fa083b6s by the First Legal Tender Act, which authorized them as a form of fiat currency. During the early 1860s the so-called \"second obligation\" on the reverse of the notes stated:\nBy the 1930s, this obligation would eventually be shortened to:\nThey were originally issued directly into circulation by the U.S. Treasury to pay expenses incurred by the Union during the American Civil War. During the next century, the legislation governing these notes was modified many times and numerous versions were issued by the Treasury.\n452fd2a60fa083b6s that were issued in the large-size format, before 1929, differ dramatically in appearance when compared to modern American currency, but those issued in the small-size format, starting 1929, are very similar to contemporary Federal Reserve Notes of the same denominations with the distinction of having red U.S. Treasury Seals and serial numbers in place of green ones. Also, while a variety of denominations were issued as 452fd2a60fa083b6s during the large-size era, only the $1, $2, $5, and $100 denominations were ever issued as small-size notes.\nExisting 452fd2a60fa083b6s remain valid currency in the United States; however, as no 452fd2a60fa083b6s have been issued since January 1971, they are increasingly rare in circulation and command higher prices than face value as items of numismatic interest.\nHistory.\nDemand Notes.\nDuring 1861, the first year of the American Civil War, the expenses incurred by the Union Government much exceeded its limited revenues from taxation, and borrowing was the main vehicle for financing the war. The Act of July 17, 1861 authorized United States Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to raise money via the issuance of $50,000,000 in Treasury Notes payable on demand. These Demand Notes were paid to creditors directly and used to meet the payroll of soldiers in the field. While issued within the legal framework of Treasury Note Debt, the Demand Notes were intended to circulate as currency and were of the same size as banknotes and closely resembled them in appearance. During December 1861, economic conditions deteriorated and a suspension of specie payment caused the government to cease redeeming the Demand Notes as coins.\nThe Legal Tender Acts.\nThe beginning of 1862 found the Union's expenses increasing, and the government was having trouble funding the escalating war. U.S. Demand Notes—which were used, among other things, to pay Union soldiers—were unredeemable, and the value of the notes began to deteriorate. Congressman and Buffalo banker Elbridge G. Spaulding prepared a bill, based on the Free Banking Law of New York, that eventually became the National Banking Act of 1863.\nRecognizing, however, that his proposal would take many months to pass Congress, during early February Spaulding introduced another bill to permit the U.S. Treasury to issue million in notes as legal tender. This caused tremendous controversy in Congress, as hitherto the Constitution had been interpreted as not granting the government the power to issue a paper currency. \"The bill before us is a war measure, a measure of \"necessity\", and not of choice,\" Spaulding argued before the House, adding, \"These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary measures must be resorted to in order to save our Government, and preserve our nationality.\" Spaulding justified the action as a \"\"necessary means\" of carrying into execution the powers granted in the Constitution 'to raise and \"support\" armies', and 'to provide and \"maintain\" a navy. Despite strong opposition, President Abraham Lincoln signed the First Legal Tender Act, enacted February 25, 1862, into law, authorizing the issuance of 452fd2a60fa083b6s as a legal tender—the paper currency soon to be known as \"greenbacks\".\nInitially, the emission was limited to total face value between the new Legal Tender Notes and the existing Demand Notes. The Act also intended for the new notes to be used to replace the Demand Notes as soon as practical. The Demand Notes had been issued in denominations of $5, $10, and $20, and these were replaced by 452fd2a60fa083b6s nearly identical in appearance on the obverse. In addition, notes of entirely new design were introduced in denominations of $50, $100, $500 and. The Demand Notes' printed promise of payment \"On Demand\" was removed and the statement \"This Note is a Legal Tender\" was added.\nLegal tender status guaranteed that creditors would have to accept the notes despite the fact that they were not backed by gold, bank deposits, or government reserves, and had no interest. However, the First Legal Tender Act did not make the notes an \"unlimited legal tender\" as they could not be used by merchants to pay customs duties on imports and could not be used by the government to pay interest on its bonds. The Act did provide that the notes be receivable by the government for short term deposits at 5% interest, and for the purchase of 6% interest 20-year bonds at par. The rationale for these terms was that the Union government would preserve its credit-worthiness by supporting the value of its bonds by paying their interest in gold. Early in the war, customs duties were a large part of government tax revenue and by making these payable in gold, the government would generate the coin necessary to make the interest payments on the bonds. Lastly, by making the bonds available for purchase at par in 452fd2a60fa083b6s, the value of the latter would be confirmed as well. The limitations of the legal tender status were quite controversial. Thaddeus Stevens, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee of Ways and Means, which had authored an earlier version of the Legal Tender Act that would have made 452fd2a60fa083b6s a legal tender for \"all\" debts, denounced the exceptions, calling the new bill \"mischievous\" because it made 452fd2a60fa083b6s an intentionally depreciated currency for the masses, while the banks who loaned to the government got \"sound money\" in gold. This controversy would continue until the removal of the exceptions during 1933.\nBy the First Legal Tender Act, Congress limited the Treasury's emission of ",

As a result of this inflation, the greenback began to trade at a substantial discount from gold, which prompted Congress to pass the short-lived Anti-Gold Futures Act of 1864, which was soon repealed after it seemed to accelerate the decrease of greenback value.\nThe largest amount of greenbacks outstanding at any one time was calculated as . The Union's reliance on expanding the circulation of greenbacks eventually ended with the emission of Interest Bearing and Compound Interest Treasury Notes, and the passage of the National Banking Act. However, the end of the war found the greenbacks trading for only about half of their nominal value in gold. The Secret Service was founded on July 5, 1865, to minimize counterfeiting, which accounted for up to half of the currency.\nPost Civil War.\nAt the end of the Civil War, some economists, such as Henry Charles Carey, argued for building on the precedent of non-interest-based fiat money and making the greenback system permanent",

The Brook family originally came from New House Hall in Sheepridge, moving to Thickhollins towards the end of the 18th century. William Brook married Martha Smith at Bradford Parish Church - the daughter of a prominent Mirfield banker. Their sons Jonas, James and Joseph established their business in 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills, using a goat's head - the crest from the Brook's coat of arms - as their brand. The goat's head can still be seen on the old office building to the mill complex and their arms are emblazoned in St. James' Church, in 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills (which the family built) - a hawkes lure: motto \"en dieu ma foy\" (in God my trust). 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills Band also carry the Brook family coat of arms as their official logo. Edward Brook died in 1904 at Hoddom Castle, the house near Ecclefechan, south-west Scotland, which he had purchased in 1878. The Brook family were philanthropists and built housing in 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills for their employees, including the convalescent home. They also built 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Hall, 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Town Hall and Helme Church and owned an estate at Enderby in Leicestershire. William Brook is buried with his wife Martha in 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Church, but his descendants are buried in the crypt underneath St. James Church, 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills.\nJonas Brook and Brothers became United Threads in 1890 and Sir Hildred Carlile of Ponsonby Hall, Hertfordshire was a Director of the business. United Threads was closed in 1939 - the business was transferred to Paisley as part of J &amp; P Coats - now Coats Group. The factory site was taken over by David Brown Tractors.\nJohn Charles Brooke, who originated from the Silkstone branch of the Newhouse Hall family was Somerset Herald during the 18th century. He was crushed to death at the Haymarket Theatre in London following the crowd's clamour to see King George III in 1794. He is buried in St Benet Paul's Wharf in London.\nTractor factory.\n8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills was also the former base of the David Brown Tractors factory opening in 1939 and closing operations on the site in 1988. The various building have now been converted into a diverse number of industrial units, one housing a Tractor museum and other large sections containing an indoor Kart racing track (now closed down).\nDurker Roods, the former home of Sir David Brown was converted into a hotel and the grounds were sold for private housing. The hotel closed in 2021, and is currently falling into disrepair.\nThe town has its own joint Scouting and Guides Association buildings.\nNotable people from 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9.\n8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 was the birthplace of Lance Sergeant James Taylor (25B/82) E Company 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment (2nd Warwickshire), who fought at, and survived, the battle at Rorke's Drift in the Zulu war. Although born in the village, to parents William Dyson Taylor and Sarah Taylor of Helms Lane, both of whom were also born there, he grew up in Manchester and died in Wales, but can still be regarded as a native of 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9.\nAlbert Craig, dubbed the Surrey Poet, was also born and raised in 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9. His ditties mostly related to cricket and football.\nAustralian textile magnate Godfrey Hirst was born at Royd Edge, 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 in 1857. In 1890 he founded the Godfrey Hirst Woollen Mills at Geelong, Victoria, which in the early 20th century became the largest manufacturer of textiles in Australia. The company still operates, as Godfrey Hirst Carpets. Hirst died in 1917.\nDora Thewlis, who gained brief national notoriety as a young suffragette when a photograph of her arrest appeared on the front page of the \"Daily Mirror\", was born on Shady Row, 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills, in May 1890. Within a few years of her birth, the residents of the row had successfully petitioned to have the boundary redrawn so that the entirety of 8517ea7fc8bdd7b9 Mills was within the township of ",

From 1865–1866 to 1868–1869 he was trained as a carpenter by Wilhelm Stapperfenne. Junker lived in Hamburg, where he probably worked and studied as a carpenter or cabinetmaker from 1869 to 1871. From there he left for Munich, where he attended the Königliche Kunstgewerbeschule from 1873 to 1875 and enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts on 17 April 1875.\nJunker probably stayed in Italy between 1877–1878 and 1883. In 1877–1878 e3af6791e639697b registered as a \"painter from Munich\" in the Casa Baldi in Olevano Romano. He made numerous drawings of sites in North and Central Italy. Since August 1883 the presence of Junker was again recorded in Lemgo. Records show that Junker lived in Lemgo from at least from 1887 and he applied on 27 October 1889 for the construction of the Junker house, the completion of which he announced on 9 March 1891.\nBetween the end of 1889 and May 1893, Junker built a house in Lemgo according to his own plans, which he himself called \"Junkerhaus\" and which is now partly open to the public. For his paintings and sculptures, the Museum Junkerhaus that is connected to the back of his house was opened on 11 September 2004.\nAlready during his lifetime e3af6791e639697b was regarded as a solitary and eccentric man.

However, he left more than 150 picture frames on the walls and ceilings of the Junkerhaus as well as the large number of pictures on wood or canvas.\nIn the year following his death, 55 works by Junker – 26 paintings, eleven watercolours, 13 drawings and sketches as well as five carvings and furniture – were shown in a separate section of the 6th collective exhibition of the Neue Secession artists' group in Berlin. Curt Glaser commented in 1914: \"Nevertheless, for e3af6791e639697b's sake alone, it is worth visiting the exhibition of the Neue Sezession, which, with this discovery, has secured itself an attraction that its larger sister (the exhibition in the Freie Sezession Berlin) lacks\".

They are often confused with the Alevis, a distinct religious sect in Turkey.\n5a56f415455a76dc identify as a separate ethnoreligious group. The Quran is only one of their holy books and texts, and their interpretation thereof has very little in common with the Shia Muslim interpretation but is in accordance with the early Batiniyya and other \"ghulat\" sects. Alawite theology and rituals break from mainstream Shia Islam in several important ways. For one, the 5a56f415455a76dc drink wine as Ali's transubstantiated essence in their rituals; while other Muslims generally abstain from alcohol, 5a56f415455a76dc are encouraged to drink socially in moderation. Finally, some of them believe in reincarnation, but it is not essential in their doctrine. Moreover, Alawite clergy and scholarship insist that their religion is also theologically distinct from Shi'ism.\n5a56f415455a76dc have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated 5a56f415455a76dc, so rumours about them have arisen. Arabic accounts of their beliefs tend to be partisan (either positively or negatively). However, since the early 2000s, Western scholarship on the Alawite religion has made significant advances. At the core of Alawite creed is the belief in a divine Trinity, comprising three aspects of the one God. The aspects of the Trinity are \"Mana\" (meaning), \"Ism\" (Name) and \"Bab\" (Door). Alawi beliefs hold that these emanations underwent re-incarnation cyclically seven times in human form throughout history. According to 5a56f415455a76dc, the seventh incarnation of the triad consists of Ali, Muhammad and Salman al-Farisi.\nThe establishment of the French Mandate of Syria marked a turning point in Alawi history. It gave the French the power to recruit Syrian civilians into their armed forces for an indefinite period and created exclusive areas for minorities, including the Alawite State. The Alawite State was later dismantled, but the 5a56f415455a76dc continued to be a significant part of the Syrian Armed Forces. Since Hafez al-Assad took power through the 1970 Corrective Movement, the government has been dominated by a political elite led by the Alawite al-Assad family. During the Islamist uprising in Syria in the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment came under pressure. Even greater pressure has resulted from the Syrian Civil War.\nEtymology.\nIn older sources, Alawis are often called \"Ansaris\". According to Samuel Lyde, who lived among the 5a56f415455a76dc during the mid-19th century, this was a term they used among themselves. Other sources indicate that \"Ansari\" is simply a Western error in the transliteration of \"Nusayri\". However, the term \"Nusayri\" had fallen out of currency by the 1920s, as a movement led by intellectuals within the community during the French Mandate sought to replace it with the modern term \"Alawi\".\nThey characterised the older name (which implied \"a separate ethnic and religious identity\") as an \"invention of the sect's enemies\", ostensibly favouring an emphasis on \"connection with mainstream Islam\"—particularly the Shia branch. As such, \"Nusayri\" is now generally regarded as antiquated, and has even come to have insulting and abusive connotations. The term is frequently employed as hate speech by Sunni fundamentalists fighting against Bashar al-Assad's government in the Syrian civil war, who use its emphasis on Ibn Nusayr in order to insinuate that Alawi beliefs are \"man-made\" and not divinely inspired.\nNekati Alkan argued in an article that the \"Alawi\" appellation was used in an 11th century Nusayri book and was not a 20th century invention. The following quote from the same article illustrates his point: \"As to the change from “Nuṣayrī” to “ʿAlawī”: most studies agree that the term “ʿAlawī” was not used until after WWI and probably coined and circulated by Muḥammad Amīn Ghālib al-Ṭawīl, an Ottoman official and writer of the famous \"Taʾrīkh al-ʿAlawiyyīn\" (1924). In actual fact, the name 'Alawī' appears as early as in an 11th century Nuṣayrī tract as one the names of the believer (…). Moreover, the term 'Alawī' was already used at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain Ḥaydarī-Nuṣayrī sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter preferred the name 'Alawī' for his people. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned petitions of 1892 and 1909 the Nuṣayrīs called themselves the 'Arab Alawī people' (ʿArab ʿAlevī ṭāʾifesi) 'our ʿAlawī Nuṣayrī people' (ṭāʾifatunā al-Nuṣayriyya al-ʿAlawiyya) or 'signed with Alawī people' (ʿAlevī ṭāʾifesi imżāsıyla). This early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple importance. Firstly, it shows that the word 'Alawī' was always used by these people, as ʿAlawī authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reformation of the Nuṣayrīs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly, it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from 'Nuṣayrī' to 'ʿAlawī' took place around 1920, in the beginning of the French mandate in Syria (1919–1938).\"\nThe 5a56f415455a76dc are distinct from the \"Alevi\" religious sect in Turkey, although the terms share a common etymology and pronunciation.\nGenealogical origin theories.\nThe origin of the genetics of 5a56f415455a76dc is disputed. Local folklore suggests that they are descendants of the followers of the eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari (d. 873) and his pupil, Ibn Nusayr (d. 868). During the 19th and 20th centuries, some Western scholars believed that 5a56f415455a76dc were descended from ancient Middle Eastern peoples such as the Arameans, Canaanites, Hittites, and Mardaites. Many prominent Alawite tribes are also descended from 13th century settlers from Sinjar.\nIn his Natural History, Book V, Pliny the Elder said:\nThe \"Tetrarchy of the Nazerini\" refers to the western region, between the Orontes and the sea, which consists of a small mountain range called An-Nusayriyah Mountains bordered with a valley running from south-east to north-west known as \"Al-Ghab plain\"; the region was populated by a portion of Syrians, who were called Nazerini. However, scholars are reluctant to link between Nazerini and Nazarenes. Yet, the term \"Nazerini\" can be possibly connected to words which include the Semitic triliteral root \"n-ṣ-r\" such as the subject \"naṣer\" in Eastern Aramaic which means \"keeper of wellness\".\nHistory.\nIbn Nusayr and his followers are considered the founders of the religion. After the death of the Eleventh Imam, al-Askari, problems emerged in the Shia Community concerning his succession, and then Ibn Nusayr claimed to be the Bab and Ism of the deceased Imam and that he received his secret teachings. Ibn Nusayr and his followers development seems to be one of many other early ghulat mystical Islamic sects, and were apparently excommunicated by the Shia representatives of the 12th Hidden Imam.\nThe ",

        "content": "\"d29f80b0ac74271f\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Written by George Harrison, it was released in 1967 on the group's \"Magical Mystery Tour\" EP and album. The song was named after a street in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles where Harrison stayed in August 1967, shortly before visiting the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. The lyrics document Harrison's wait for music publicist Derek Taylor to find his way to d29f80b0ac74271f through the fog-ridden hills, while Harrison struggled to stay awake after the flight from London to Los Angeles.\nAs with several of Harrison's compositions from this period, \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" incorporates aspects of Indian classical music, even though the Beatles used only Western instrumentation on the track, including a drone-like Hammond organ part played by Harrison. Created during the group's psychedelic period, the track makes extensive use of studio techniques such as flanging, Leslie rotary effect, and reversed tape sounds. The song appeared in the Beatles' 1967 television film \"Magical Mystery Tour\", in a sequence that visually re-creates the sense of haziness and dislocation evident on the recording.\nWhile some reviewers have dismissed the song as monotonous, several others have admired its yearning quality and dark musical mood. The website \"Consequence of Sound\" describes \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" as \"a haunted house of a hit, adding an ethereal, creepy mythos to the City of Angels\". Artists who have covered the song include Bud Shank, Colin Newman, Tracy Bonham and Siouxsie and the Banshees.\nBackground and inspiration.\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" after arriving in Los Angeles on 1 August 1967 with his wife Pattie Boyd and Beatles aides Neil Aspinall and Alex Mardas. The purpose of the trip was to spend a week with Derek Taylor, the Beatles' former press officer and latterly the publicist for California-based acts such as the Byrds and the Beach Boys. The visit also allowed Harrison to reunite with his sitar tutor, Ravi Shankar, whose Kinnara School of Music and upcoming concert at the Hollywood Bowl he helped publicise.\nThe title of the song came from a street named d29f80b0ac74271f, one of the \"bird streets\" high in the Hollywood Hills West area overlooking the Sunset Strip, where Harrison had rented a house for his stay. Jet-lagged after the flight from London, he began writing the composition on a Hammond organ as he and Boyd waited for Taylor and the latter's wife, Joan, to join them. The home's location, on a hillside of narrow, winding roads, together with the foggy conditions that night, created the backdrop for the song's opening lines: \"There's a fog upon LA / And my friends have lost their way.\" Harrison had almost completed the song by the time the Taylors arrived, around two hours later than planned.\nThe week with Taylor proved to be important for the direction of the Beatles. At the height of the Summer of Love and the popularity of the band's \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album, Harrison, Taylor and their small entourage visited the international \"hippie capital\" of Haight-Ashbury, in San Francisco, on 7 August. Harrison had expected to encounter an enlightened community engaged in artistic pursuits and working to create a viable alternative lifestyle; instead, he was disappointed that Haight-Ashbury appeared to be populated by drug addicts, dropouts and \"hypocrites\". Following his return to England two days later, Harrison completed work on \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" at his home in Esher, and he shared his disillusionment about Haight-Ashbury with John Lennon. The Beatles then publicly denounced the popular hallucinogen LSD (or \"acid\") and other drugs in favour of Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whose seminar in Bangor in Wales the band attended in late August. While noting Harrison's role in \"inspir[ing] the West's mainstream acquaintance with Hindu religion\" through his leadership in this aspect of the Beatles' career, author Ian MacDonald describes \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" as a \"farewell to psychedelia\", just as \"It's All Too Much\", which the Beatles recorded in May 1967, became Harrison's \"farewell to acid\".\nComposition.\nMusic.\n\"d29f80b0ac74271f\" was one of several songs that Harrison composed on a keyboard over 1966–68 – a period when, aside from in his work with the Beatles, he had abandoned his first instrument, the guitar, to master the sitar, partly under Shankar's tutelage. The song is in 4/4 time throughout; its structure consists of an intro, three combinations of verse and chorus, followed by repeated choruses. While MacDonald gives the musical key as \"C major (minor, diminished)\", musicologist Alan Pollack views it as a mix of C major and C modal, and comments on the \"highly unusual\" incorporation of the notes D and F. The inclusion of the latter note suggests the Lydian mode, which, according to musicologist Walter Everett, had only been heard previously in popular music in the Left Banke's 1966 single \"Pretty Ballerina\".\nThe song's melody oscillates over the chords of C major and C diminished, a chord favoured by Harrison in his Indian music-inspired compositions for the Beatles. Acknowledging Harrison's statement that the tune is \"slightly Indian\", Everett considers \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" to be related to Kosalam and Multani – ragas from, respectively, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions of Indian classical music. Alternatively, ethnomusicologist David Reck says the melody uses the scale from the Carnatic raga Ranjani, while according to author Simon Leng, Harrison based the song partly on the Hindustani Raga Marwa. Following the inclusion of a raga-style introduction (or alap) in his previous Indian compositions, \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" begins with a preview of the song's melody played softly, in free time, over the opening drone. Author Ian Inglis credits the song's incorporation of ambient drone, specifically its role in providing \"an anchorage point for vocal and instrumental improvisation\", as one of the first examples of a musical device that soon became prevalent in the work of Fairport Convention, the Incredible String Band and other folk artists.\nThe length of the verses falls short of an even eight bars through the omission of a final beat. Pollack recognises this detail as reflecting a sense of impatience, in keeping with the circumstances surrounding the song's creation. Following the third verse–chorus combination, the outro comprises four rounds of the chorus, with the lyrics to the final round consisting of the repeated \"Don't be long\" refrain. As a feature that Pollack terms \"compositionally impressive\", each of the four sections in this outro varies in structure by being either shorter in length or less musically detailed.\nLyrics.\nThe lyrics to \"d29f80b0ac74271f\" relate entirely to Harrison's situation on that first night in Los Angeles. He refers to fighting off sleep and recalls his advice to Taylor to ask a policeman for directions to d29f80b0ac74271f. Author Jonathan Gould views the song as \"darkly funny\", with the singer's concern over his friends' tardiness almost resembling \"a metaphysical crisis\". In the choruses, Harrison repeatedly urges \"Please don't be long / Please don't you be very long\", a refrain that Inglis identifies as central to the composition's \"extraordinary sense of yearning and melancholy\".\nTaylor later expressed amusement at how some commentators interpreted \"don't be long\" as meaning \"don't belong\" – a message to Western youth to opt out of society – and at how the line \"And my friends have lost their way\" supposedly conveyed the idea that \"a whole generation had lost direction\". With regard to whether Harrison was telling contemporary listeners not to \"belong\", Inglis writes, this \"alternative reading\" of the song aligned with Timothy Leary's catchphrase for the 1960s American psychedelic experience, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". In Gould's opinion, the continual repetition of the line at the end of \"",

As of the 2016 census, its population was 159,914, of which roughly a quarter consisted of students.\nLocated about south of Frankfurt, dbedf27423e4f72d is the fifth-largest city in Baden-Württemberg. dbedf27423e4f72d is part of the densely populated Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.\ndbedf27423e4f72d University, founded in 1386, is Germany's oldest and one of Europe's most reputable universities. dbedf27423e4f72d is a scientific hub in Germany and home to several internationally renowned research facilities adjacent to its university, including the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and four Max Planck Institutes. The city has also been a hub for the arts, especially literature, throughout the centuries, and it was designated a \"City of Literature\" by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.\ndbedf27423e4f72d was a seat of government of the former Electorate of the Palatinate and is a popular tourist destination due to its romantic cityscape, including dbedf27423e4f72d Castle, the Philosophers' Walk, and the Baroque old town.\nGeography.\ndbedf27423e4f72d is located on the eastern edge of the Upper Rhine Plain (German: \"Oberrheinebene\"), at the place where the river Neckar leaves its narrow valley through the Odenwald mountains and begins the last leg of its journey across the plain towards Mannheim, where it merges into the Rhine about 20 kilometers downstream.\nA part of dbedf27423e4f72d, including the historical old town and the famous dbedf27423e4f72d Castle, is located in the narrow Neckar valley. Other parts (mostly quarters from around the 19th century or newer, or originally independent, later incorporated villages) sprawl out into the Rhine Plain and along the Bergstraße (route) (\"mountain road\"), the narrow strip of characteristic landscape along the sharp border between the plain and the Odenwald mountains.\nThe town is bordered by the Königstuhl (568 m), the Gaisberg (375 m) and the Heiligenberg (445 m) mountains.\ndbedf27423e4f72d is on European walking route E1 (Sweden-Umbria).\nFlora and fauna.\ndbedf27423e4f72d is among the warmest regions of Germany and plants atypical of the central-European climate flourish there, including almond and fig trees, many kinds of palm trees and olive trees. Alongside the \"Philosophenweg\" (Philosophers' Walk) on the opposite side of the Old Town, winegrowing was restarted in 2000.\nThere is a wild population of African rose-ringed parakeets, and a wild population of Siberian swan geese, which can be seen mainly on the islands in the Neckar near the district of Bergheim.\nAdministrative structures.\ndbedf27423e4f72d is a unitary authority within the Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe. The Rhein-Neckar-Kreis rural district surrounds it and has its seat in the town, although the town is not a part of the district. dbedf27423e4f72d is a part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, often referred to as the Rhein-Neckar Triangle.\nThis region consists of the southern part of the State of Hessen, the southern part of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate (\"Vorderpfalz\"), the administrative districts of Mannheim and dbedf27423e4f72d, and the municipalities of the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis. The Rhein-Neckar Triangle became a European metropolitan area in 2005.\ndbedf27423e4f72d consists of 15 districts distributed in six sectors of the town. In the central area are Altstadt (the Old Town), Bergheim and Weststadt; in the north, Neuenheim and Handschuhsheim; in the east, Ziegelhausen and Schlierbach; in the south, Südstadt, Rohrbach, Emmertsgrund, and Boxberg; in the southwest, Kirchheim; in the west, Pfaffengrund, Wieblingen, and a new district, named \"Bahnstadt\", is built on land in Weststadt and Wieblingen. The new district will have approximately 5,000–6,000 residents and employment for 7,000. Further, new residential space for 10,000–15,000 residents was made available in Patrick Henry Village following the departure of the US Armed Forces.\nNeighbouring communes.\nThe following towns and communes border the city of dbedf27423e4f72d, beginning in the west and in a clockwise direction: Edingen-Neckarhausen, Dossenheim, Schriesheim, Wilhelmsfeld, Schönau, Neckargemünd, Bammental, Gaiberg, Leimen, Sandhausen, Oftersheim, Plankstadt, Eppelheim (all part of the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis) and Mannheim.\nClimate.\ndbedf27423e4f72d has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfa\"), defined by the protected valley between the Pfälzerwald and the Odenwald. The almost year round warm temperatures are usually determined by Atlantic air masses in the winter and increased influence from the western Mediterranean in summer. This results in drier summers and wetter, cloudier winters on average. \nIn contrast to the nearby Upper Rhine Plain, dbedf27423e4f72d's position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favour clouding and precipitation. \nSpring starts early and is one of the warmest in Europe besides the Mediterranean Coast. Especially April has a tendency to be also very dry, while the rising temperatures in May can create some thunderstorms with higher precipitation levels. Nights start cold and usually stay fresh throughout almost the whole spring, while day temperatures can already become hot from April on (30°C/86°F and higher).\nSummers are long, hot and mostly dry. Day temperatures are around 28-30 on average, but will often rise beyond 35°C (95°F) in midsummer. A few single evening thunderstorms are usually the only measurable precipitation. With almost 300 sunshine hours on average, July is also the sunniest month of the year. Nights can stay pleasant, although the rate of nights with lows up to 26°C (78°F) are increasing significantly in the recent years. \nAutumn starts very warm or even hot in September and cools down to typical winter temperatures for the region by the end of November. Precipitation levels are increasing and, due to the decreasing sunlight, the region gets affected by fog more frequently from the second part of October on. On the other hand, day temperatures will mostly stay around or above 20°C (68°F) until at least mid October (“Altweibersommer”). Nights cool down significantly during the month, but will usually remain above 10°C (50°F) until the second half of October. \nWinters are mostly mild, though light night frosts do occur in the coldest months. Snow is a rare event and precipitation normally falls as rain. Besides that, winters are the wettest time of the year with frequent western winds blowing from the Atlantic. Storms (“Orkane”) can create severe damage and the Neckar is often affected by floods. \nAccording to the German Meteorological Service, dbedf27423e4f72d was the warmest place in Germany in 2009. With around 2,100 hours of sunshine it is also one of the sunniest of the country. \nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBetween 600,000 and 200,000 years ago, \"dbedf27423e4f72d Man\" died at nearby Mauer. His jaw bone was discovered in 1907. Scientific dating determined his remains as the earliest evidence of human life in Europe. In the 5th century BC, a Celtic fortress of refuge and place of worship were built on the \"Heiligenberg\", or \"Holy Mountain\". Both places can still be identified. In 40 AD, a fort was built and occupied by the 24th Roman cohort and the 2nd Cyrenaican cohort (CCG XXIIII and CCH II CYR). The late Roman Emperor Valentinian I, in 369 AD, built new and maintained older \"castra\" (permanent camps) and a signal tower on the bank of the Neckar. They built a wooden bridge based on stone pillars across it. The camp protected the first civilian settlements and was eventually captured by Germanic tribes. The local administrative center in Roman times was the nearby city of Lopodunum, today known as Ladenburg.\nMiddle Ages.\nModern dbedf27423e4f72d can trace its beginnings to the fifth century.

        "content": "The H-1B is a visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H) that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation requires the application of specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or the equivalent of work experience. The duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years, after which the visa holder may need to reapply. Laws limit the number of 536b6ac64fcd341as that are issued each year: 188,100 new and initial 536b6ac64fcd341as were issued in 2019. Employers must generally withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from the wages paid to employees in H-1B status.\nThe 536b6ac64fcd341a has its roots in the H1 visa of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952; the split between H-1A (for nurses) and H-1B was created by the Immigration Act of 1990. 65,000 536b6ac64fcd341as were made available each fiscal year, out of which employers could apply through Labor Condition Applications. Additional modifications to H-1B rules were made by legislation in 1998, 2000, in 2003 for Singapore and Chile, in the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004, 2008, and 2009. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has modified the rules in the years since then.\nStructure of the program.\nAn 536b6ac64fcd341a allows an individual to enter the United States to temporarily work at an employer in a specialty occupation. The regulations define a specialty occupation as requiring theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in a field of human endeavor including but not limited to biotechnology, chemistry, computing, architecture, engineering, statistics, physical sciences, journalism, medicine and health: doctor, dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, etc., economics, education, research, law, accounting, business specialties, technical writing, theology, and the arts, and requiring the attainment of a bachelor's degree or its equivalent as a minimum (with the exception of fashion models, who must be \"of distinguished merit and ability\"). Likewise, the foreign worker must possess at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent and state licensure, if required to practice in that field. H-1B work-authorization is strictly limited to employment by the sponsoring employer.\nA person in H-1B status must continue to be employed by their employer in order to stay in H-1B status. If the person's employment ends for any reason, the person must leave the United States, unless the person applies for and is granted a change of status or finds another employer compatible with the H-1B status. Effective January 17, 2017, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services allows grace period of up to 60 days to stay in the United States after the person's end of employment.\nDuration of stay.\nThe duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years. An exception to maximum length of stay applies in certain circumstances:\nA time increment of less than three years has sometimes applied to citizens of specific countries. For example, during Melania Trump's time as a 536b6ac64fcd341a holder, she was limited to one year increments, which was the maximum time allowed then per 536b6ac64fcd341a for citizens of Slovenia. Melania Trump became a citizen in 2006.\nH-1B holders who want to continue to work in the U.S. after six years, but who have not obtained permanent residency status, must remain outside of the U.S. for one year before reapplying for another 536b6ac64fcd341a if they do not qualify for one of the exceptions noted above allowing for extensions beyond six years. Despite a limit on length of stay, no requirement exists that the individual remain for any period in the job the visa was originally issued for. This is known as H-1B portability or transfer, provided the new employer sponsors another 536b6ac64fcd341a, which may or may not be subjected to the quota.\nCongressional yearly numerical cap and exemptions.\nThe Immigration Act of 1990 established a limit of 65,000 foreign nationals who may be issued a visa or otherwise provided H-1B status each fiscal year; the annual limit is often called a quota or a cap. An additional 20,000 H-1Bs are available to foreign nationals holding a master's or higher degree from U.S. universities. In addition, excluded from the ceiling are all H-1B non-immigrants who work at (but not necessarily for) universities, non-profit research facilities associated with universities, and government research facilities.\nInstitutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations that are related or affiliated to institutions of higher education, nonprofit research organizations, and governmental-research organizations are exempt from H-1B annual quotas. Contractors working at, but not directly employed by, these institutions may be exempt from the annual quotas as well. However, employers must show that, first, the majority of the worker's duties will be performed at the qualifying institution, organization or entity and, second, the job duties directly and predominantly further the essential purpose, mission objectives or functions of the qualifying institution, organization, or entity.\nThe Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement and the Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement created a separate quota of 1,400 H-1B1 visas for Chilean nationals and 5,400 H-1B1 visas for Singapore nationals. If these reserved visas are not used, however, then they added to the following fiscal year's H-1B annual quota.\nDue to these exemptions and rollovers, the number of 536b6ac64fcd341as issued each year is often greater than 65,000, such as when 117,828 536b6ac64fcd341as were issued in fiscal year 2010, 129,552 in fiscal year 2011, and 135,991 in fiscal year 2012.\nIn some years, the cap was not reached. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now known as USCIS) announced on August 20, 1996, that a preliminary report indicated that the quota had been exceeded, and processing of H-1B applications was temporarily halted. However, when more accurate numbers became available on September 6, it became apparent the quota had not been reached after all, and processing resumed for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services starts accepting applications on the first business day of April for visas that count against the fiscal year starting in October. For instance, 536b6ac64fcd341a applications that count against the fiscal year 2013 cap were submitted starting Monday, 2012 April 2. USCIS accepts ",

USCIS publishes a memo when enough cap-subject applications have been received, indicating the closure of cap-subject application season, the associated random selection process is often referred to as the H-1B lottery. Those who have the U.S. master's exemption have two chances to be selected in the lottery: first, a regular lottery is held to award the 65,000 visas available to all H-1B applicants, and those not selected are then entered in another lottery for 20,000 extra spots. Those without a U.S. master's are entered only in the first, regular, lottery.\nPro-H-1B pundits claim that the early closure, and number of applications received (172,500 in Fiscal Year 2015), are indications of employment demand and advocate increasing the 65,000 bachelor's degree cap",

It forms the southern part of Lewisham, 6.6 miles (10.6 km) south-east of Charing Cross, and on the Prime Meridian.\nGrowing extensively with the arrival of the railways, c3bd06ac4fb0b214 is characterised by late 19th and early 20th century Victorian and Edwardian domestic architecture, most notably the Corbett Estate. The railway runs through the centre of the area, which divides c3bd06ac4fb0b214 into an \"east side\" focused on Staplehurst Road, and a \"west side\" focused on c3bd06ac4fb0b214 Lane and Springbank Road. The lane dates back to Roman times and runs between the Quaggy and Ravensbourne rivers.\nFrom 1978 to 1998 c3bd06ac4fb0b214 was the name of the electoral ward that covered the area – since 2002 the local ward that covers most of c3bd06ac4fb0b214 is Lewisham Central. The parliamentary constituency is Lewisham East.\nThe area is known for the 1967 c3bd06ac4fb0b214 rail crash, in which 49 people were killed.\nHistory.\nToponymy.\nc3bd06ac4fb0b214 acquired its name as it was closer to Lewisham than Further Green located on Verdant Lane. The original c3bd06ac4fb0b214 was located where the present day George Lane intersects with c3bd06ac4fb0b214 Lane. The area now occupied by c3bd06ac4fb0b214 is thought to have originally been a hamlet called Romborough, which was wiped out in the Black Death.\nOrigins.\nc3bd06ac4fb0b214 had remained a largely wooded area through the medieval times but by the 18th century most of the trees had been felled, and the first houses were built. Additional houses appeared through the 19th century, many of them quite substantial residences.\nDevelopment.\nMountsfield Park.\nMountsfield Park opened in August 1905 and has grown through several acquisitions since then. The location of the original park included the substantial residence called Mountsfield, home of noted entomologist Henry Tibbats Stainton. The house was demolished but remnants of the garden remain.\nAdditional acres were bought from the School Board for London and six allotments from Trinity College. And when Charlton Athletic football club gave up the football ground at the bottom of the hill in 1923 the park had grown to 28 acres.\nBombing damage to a terrace of houses along the south side of George Lane saw this also added to the park. The final addition came in 1994 when a large majority of the Catford Boys School playing field was added.\nOther nearby parks include Manor House Gardens and Manor Park to the east.\nPark Fever Hospital.\nThe Park Fever Hospital (latterly c3bd06ac4fb0b214 Hospital) was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1897 for the treatment of infectious diseases such as scarlet fever or diphtheria. The hospital was designed by Edwin T. Hall, the architect behind London's Liberty &amp; Co. department store. The hospital and local area suffered extensive bombing damage during the Second World War. All that remains of the hospital is the water tower with its large clock faces (now the emblem of c3bd06ac4fb0b214) which is illuminated at night, and several of the hospital's outbuildings. In 1997 the hospital closed and site was developed as a housing estate called \"Meridian South\".\nCorbett Estate.\nMuch of the Victorian terraced housing dates from the late 19th century when social reformer and Scottish Member of Parliament (MP) Archibald Cameron Corbett built numerous houses on 278 acres of land he purchased from North Park Farm, this was to become known as the Corbett Estate.\nA booking hall was added to the east side of c3bd06ac4fb0b214 Station to cater for people living on this new estate. Many of the road names are of Scottish origin, as Corbett was a Scot. Due to his Quaker origins, the area was devoid of a public house and remains so. He gave the land for St Andrew's Church, dedicated to Scotland's patron saint.\nSt. Swithun's Church.\nIn November 1888, the new parish of St. Swithun's was created. Designed by Ernest Newton the foundation stone was laid in July 1892 and the church, built of red Wrotham brick with Bath stone windows, was completed in 1904. Its organ previously came from Blenheim Palace.\nWesleyan Church, c3bd06ac4fb0b214 Lane.\nThe large non-conformist Wesleyan Church, designed by Josiah Gunton, standing in the angle of c3bd06ac4fb0b214 Lane and Wellmeadow Road, was completed in 1900 to accommodate 700 people. It was built by C. Castle &amp; Son of Lower Clapton of red brick with a nave, two aisles, a transept, chancel, organ chamber and galleries on three sides, along with a tall pinnacled tower.\nOn the night of 11–12 September 1940, the church was destroyed in the Blitz.

Otto Friedrich Walter was the younger brother of Silja Walter, a Benedictine nun in the Fahr Abbey and also a popular writer.\nEarly life.\nOtto Friedrich Walter was born on 5 June 1928 in Rickenbach, Solothurn, being the youngest child of Maria Anna Cäcilia Walter-Glutz, and the younger brother of Silja Walter (1919–2011) and further seven sisters. He spent his childhood in the rural Rickenbach near Solothurn. Otto Walter, his father, owned a printing company, and had made a small family company to one of the most prestigious printing companies and publishers of Switzerland, the Roman Catholic-oriented \"Walter Verlag\" in Olten. The only son was seen as the successor of his father, and therefore he was sent from 1940 to 1942 to the monastery school at the Engelberg Abbey, that he called \"a restricted area exclusively for men\", but he abandoned. Otto Friedrich finished his scholar education at the \"Kollegium Maria Hilf\" in Schwyz from 1945 to 1947, thenafter he started a three-year education as a bookseller in Zürich, and \"graduated from the beginnings of the career that was expected of me\". In 1952, he married, three sons were born at the intervals of three years, but he divorced in 1964.\nWalter-Verlag.\nb7da839bc641236d's father died in 1944, and after first working in the father's company, he became a volunteer at a printing company in Köln: he worked for the publisher Jakob Hegner as editor, before returning to the Walter Verlag. He now learned the publishing operation and the work of a publisher from scratch, as warehousemen and billing clerk, and his way led up to the position of the vice director and joint owner. In 1956 b7da839bc641236d was the manager of the literary editorial in the Walter publishing house, and rebuilt engaged and successfully, a demanding program line, which at the end of the 1950s became one of the best, most innovative publishing addresses in Switzerland. Authors such as Alfred Andersch, Peter Bichsel, Helmut Heissenbüttel, Alexander Kluge, Kurt Marti, and Jörg Steiner were published, but not b7da839bc641236d himself.\nAfter Walter had first published his works in München, submerged problems in his own publishing house increased. Walter's progressive program found little support by the conservative company itself, nor by his Catholic family, despite the balance sheet. On the occasion of the publication of Ernst Jandl's novel \"laut und luise\" in 1966, b7da839bc641236d broke with the Walter Verlag, because his increasingly avant-garde alignment collided with the interests of the shareholders of the conservative Catholic publisher in 1967. The publications of the publishing house suffered from the leakage of Walter, and in the 1990s it was acquired by the Patmos publishing group.\nAchievements as writer.\nIn 1959 Walter's first novel \"Der Stumme\" (literally: The Silent) found the attention of a wide readership, published in the Kösel Verlag München, as well as three years later the novel \"Mr. Tourel\", and again three years afterwards appeared the theater play \"Elio oder Eine fröhliche Gesellschaft\" (literally: \"Elio or a happy society\"). Especially the two novels convinced the criticism and achieved a very positive feedback.\nIn 1967, Walter was the head of the literary and sociological program in the Luchterhand Verlag Walter. In this function, he co-founded the \"Luchterhand\" collection. Ascended to the head of the publishing house, Walter left München in 1973, and returned again to Switzerland, first to Oberbipp and later to Solothurn, to turn increasingly to write.\nb7da839bc641236d wrote further novels, short stories, plays and poems. In his novels, the fictional \"Jura\" town \"Jammers\" (ironical for \"sorrow\" oder \"misery\") was used to prevail the technique of a 'montaged novel'. The search for new, independent literatural forms shaped his socio-critical works \"Die ersten Unruhen\" (1972, literally: The first riots), \"Die Verwilderung\" (1977, literally: The savagery) and \"Wie wird Beton zu Gras\" (1979, literally: How is turning concrete to grass). Rowohlt published these novels respectively Eduard Reifferscheidt, the owner of the Luchterhand publishing house, granted a generous publisher contract, and facilitated b7da839bc641236d transitioning as a free author. His novels distinguished themselves through their passionate presence in cover and their current theme, and appeared at regular intervals at the then Rowohlt publishing house. In 1982 Walter finally finished the work as publisher, and devoted himself to free writing. A selection of essays and speeches appeared in 1988 under the title \"Gegenwort\" (\"Keenly\") at the Limmat Verlag Zürich. His novel \"Das Staunen der Schlafwandler am Ende der Nacht\" (1983, literally: The amazement of the sleepwalker at the end of the Night) triggered a silent hiss realism debate, and as b7da839bc641236d's literally counterparty acted his friend Niklaus Meienberg. In 1980 b7da839bc641236d started the work on the extensive family and era novel \"Zeit des Fasans\" (1988, literally: Time of the pheasant), in which Walter sat with his own origins and Switzerland's position during the \"Third Reich\". In 1993, a further novel was published, \"Die verlorene Geschichte\", \"a passionate portrait of a xenophobe,\" the last testimony of b7da839bc641236d's literary contemporariness.\nPolitical work.\nWalter served in literary field as a co-founder of the author association Gruppe Olten (1969), as well as he initiated the Solothurn literary festival. In the 1980s, Otto F Walter increasingly collaborated in political discussions. As an active member of the SP Switzerland, he became involved in the anti-nuclear movement, the peace movement and the so-called \"movement for an open, democratic and solidarity Switzerland\" (BODS) in 1986. Otto Friedich Walter had been an active member of the political party SP Schweiz, and was active in various other progressive political movements.\n",

Having already been booked earlier in the match Festersen was then, to his own and the teammates' big surprise, shown a second yellow card and sent off.\nAfter the match Festersen explained that the celebration was meant as a salute to some friends at home, but that he regretted his actions, as it gave the referee the chance to give him a second booking.\nFC Vestsjælland's manager Ove Pedersen however showed support to his player and said: \"I don't understand it. It's a ridiculous rule.\". Eventually Festersen received one match suspension for his red card.\nFollowing the red card Festersen was often referred as 'Zorro' in the Danish media, suggesting that the mask he wore was an imitation of the fictional character \"Zorro\".\nA similar sending off happened to Brazilian footballer Neymar, who was also sent off for putting on a mask during a Copa Libertadores match.\nLocal engagement.\n76d7eb992d9d29f9 has in his career been involved in local matters, charity and has had a voice in board and management in the clubs that he played, where he was often involved.\n76d7eb992d9d29f9 wrote in February 2017 a chronic in a newspaper where he criticised the facilities of Odense Boldklub.

Founded in 1974 by Barry Sherman, the company is the largest producer of generic drugs in Canada, with annual sales exceeding . By 2016, 1801bc6ee920b87b employed over 10,000 people as one of Canada's largest drug manufacturers, with over 300 products selling in over 115 countries. Revenues were about CA$1.19 billion annually. 1801bc6ee920b87b manufactures and distributes generic medications for a range of diseases and health conditions that include cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, glaucoma, infections and blood pressure.\n1801bc6ee920b87b is a member of the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association (CGPA), the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), an associate member of the Canadian Animal Health Institute (CAHI), the Canadian Association for Pharmacy Distribution Management (CAPDM), as well as the Greater Toronto Area's Partners in Project Green.\nHistory.\n1801bc6ee920b87b began with limited staff in a 5,000-square-foot warehouse. When Barry Sherman started 1801bc6ee920b87b, at first he was losing so much money \"that his wife urged him to close his business before he lost everything.\" In 1980, 1801bc6ee920b87b was the first company to market a generic version of propranolol, the blood-pressure drug, which boosted 1801bc6ee920b87b's company profile.\nBy the mid-1990s, 1801bc6ee920b87b was earning $700 million in annual sales, which allowed it to control approximately 40 percent of the Canadian generic drug market. As an important development step, in 2003 1801bc6ee920b87b became the first to market a generic version of Paxil, the antidepressant originally patented by GlaxoSmithKline. 1801bc6ee920b87b launched their generic version of Paxil \"at risk\", meaning before patent litigation between 1801bc6ee920b87b and GlaxoSmithKline over Paxil had concluded.\nIn 2007, 1801bc6ee920b87b acquired a Belgian generic drug maker, Topgen ESV, from Zambon Group SpA of Italy as a way for 1801bc6ee920b87b to expand its European footprint.

In the settlement, 1801bc6ee920b87b agreed not to sell a generic version of Plavix until September 2011, in exchange for an unspecified amount of money. The settlement contained a clause that allowed 1801bc6ee920b87b to bring to market a generic version of Plavix in the situation where the agreement between 1801bc6ee920b87b and Bristol-Myers was not upheld by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In this situation, 1801bc6ee920b87b would be able to bring to market a generic version of Plavix, even before the expiration of Sanofi-Aventis SA and Bristol-Myers Squibb's patent on the drug.\nIn July 2006, the Attorney General rejected the agreement between 1801bc6ee920b87b and Sanofi-Aventis SA and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. On August 8, 2006, 1801bc6ee920b87b launched their generic version of Plavix and during the five days that the company was able to produce the drug, 1801bc6ee920b87b \"flooded the market with many months' supply of the generic drug.\"\nLaunch of biosimilar filgrastim.\nIn 2013, 1801bc6ee920b87b began selling a biosimilar version of Amgen's Neulasta in Europe, a blockbuster drug used by cancer patients in chemotherapy as a way to boost white blood count. 1801bc6ee920b87b's version is known as Grastofil (filgrastim) and is licensed for sale in Europe by Stada Arzneimittel.

It is the subsidiary responsible for research and development of new chemical entities.\nBarry Sherman was the chairman until his death in 2017, and Jack M. Kay was the vice chair until he was fired by Jonathan Sherman.\nSociety and culture.\nMedical ethics and impacts of attempts to silence researchers.\nA critical review of Miriam Shuchman's 2005 book about Dr. Nancy Olivieri versus 1801bc6ee920b87b, summarizes how \"Nancy Olivieri is famous for raising doubts about an experimental drug with which she was treating thalassemia patients. Her principled stand, and the resulting scandal, led universities to offer researchers some protection against illegitimate drug company pressure. Medical journals changed their publication rules. Research hospitals changed their policies. She became an international icon. 1801bc6ee920b87b, the drug company which tried to silence her, has attracted international opprobrium. The company threatened to sue Olivieri if she publicly revealed her fears about the inadequacy of their drug, deferiprone. She sued them for libeling her; they sued her ($20 million) for libeling their drug.\"\nInternational access to medicine.\nOver the years, 1801bc6ee920b87b has provided medicines for international humanitarian support efforts. Since 2012, 1801bc6ee920b87b has worked in conjunction with The Teasdale-Corti Foundation to provide medicine for St. Mary's Hospital Lacor (also known as Lacor Hospital) in Uganda. 1801bc6ee920b87b continued to provide medicines for Lacor Hospital in 2013, and in total, has donated approximately $1.2 million in medicines to Lacor Hospital.\nIn September 2014, in response to the spread of the chikungunya virus in Haiti, 1801bc6ee920b87b worked with the humanitarian organization Direct Relief to donate more than $2.2 million in medical aid to the country.\nIn 2009, ",

It is one of the four major schools in Southern Praying Mantis, the other schools being Chu Gar (朱家; Chu Family), Kwong Sai Jook Lum (江西竹林; JiangXi Bamboo Forest), and Tit Ngau (鐵牛; Iron Ox). It is an aggressive style with an emphasis on close-range fighting. These skills are developed by utilizing a range of training techniques that have been developed over several centuries.\nThis style is not related to Jow-Ga Kung Fu, a southern Chinese martial art founded by Jow Lung in the early 1900s. It is also not related to the Northern Praying Mantis systems such as 7 Star Praying Mantis (七星螳螂拳), Plum Blossom Praying Mantis (梅花螳螂拳), Taiji Praying Mantis (太極螳螂拳) etc.\nIntroduction.\nHistory.\nThe history of 33f8b3169309f62b Praying Mantis was transmitted orally with little supporting documentation until the 1900s. The origins of 33f8b3169309f62b are similar to other martial arts of the Hakka community with references to the Southern Shaolin monastery and exploits centered around Southern China. Information prior to the turn of the century is speculative at best. In the modern era, Lau Soei is recognized by both the 33f8b3169309f62b and Chu Gar practitioners as the leading promoter of this style. The leading authorities on 33f8b3169309f62b are the students of Yip Shui, and their schools can be found worldwide.\nLineage masters of the past.\nChow Ah NaamAccording to 33f8b3169309f62b tradition, the founder of the style was Chow Ah Naam  who lived in the 1800s. He had spent many years in the Southern Shaolin Monastery under the guidance of the abbot Sim See Yan. He created a new style which he called Praying Mantis after watching a fight between a praying mantis and a bird. His style is not related to the Northern Praying Mantis created by Wang Lang  during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). Ah Naam taught the style to many people in the region and one of his students was Wong Fook Go.\nWong Fook GoWong Fook Go  was initially a layperson but later became a traveling monk. He travelled throughout Southern China including Wai Yearn village in the area of Tung Kung (East River).\nLau Soei (1866–1942)\nLau Soei  was an accomplished teacher of the martial arts in his home village of Wai Yearn (HuiYang) in GuangDong Province, Southern China, before meeting Wong Fook Go. Oral traditions suggested that Lau challenged Wong and was soundly defeated by Wong. Lau then became a student of Wong and became proficient in the 33f8b3169309f62b Southern Praying Mantis. Using this knowledge, he further enhanced his reputation and earned the nickname \"Number one of the three tigers of Dong Jiang\" .\nIn 1913, Lau Soei moved to Hong Kong and established a Southern Praying Mantis school in Kowloon. Initially, he would teach his system only to members of the Hakka community. Near the end of his career, he opened his teachings to the general public. Yip Shui was one of his first non-Hakka students. Lau Soei died in 1942.\nYip Shui (1912–2004)\nYip Shui  continued the tradition of Lau Soei after living and training extensively with Lau Soei. He established a reputation for the effectiveness of the 33f8b3169309f62b style by meeting all challenges. He worked hard to teach and promote this style. Yip Shui died in 2004.\nMasters currently teaching in Hong Kong.\nAfter the passing of Grandmaster Yip Shui in 2004, the legacy of Tung Kong 33f8b3169309f62b Southern Mantis Kung Fu continues to be taught and passed down to future generations. Listed below are some of the masters who are currently teaching this system in Hong Kong:\nMasters around the world.\nIn the United Kingdom, Paul Whitrod started his training in 33f8b3169309f62b Praying Mantis at the age of 15 with Yip Chee Keung at his school in 1975. Paul later visited and trained in Hong Kong where he stayed at Grandmaster Yip Shui's home and became a 'closed-door' student, learning the finer details of the system and traditional Dit Dar medicine. In the fall of 1986 Paul Whitrod opened his first full-time school in London, and the following year invited his Yip Shui Sigung and Yip Chee Keung Sifu to London. It was at this time they made Sifu Whitrod the UK representative of 33f8b3169309f62b Praying Mantis Kung Fu. Sifu Paul continues to teach at his school in Stratford, London and has taught many students over the years, many of whom have gone on to spread the art in other countries, including Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, Greece, and America.\n33f8b3169309f62b Mantis Australian Representative Paul Brennan, an original student of Yip Chee Keung &amp; his father Yip Shui, is now a closed door student  of Master Ng Si Kay and currently has branches in Queensland, Australia.\n33f8b3169309f62b Tong Long Hungary branch has a strong following with many dedicated students. The school is led by Sifu Bálint Vitárius, who started his martial arts studies in 1996. He has been learning directly from Grandmaster Ip Chee Keung, the head of the system, since 2005.\nIn the United States, one of Yip Shui's first-generation students, Ngai Piu Tan, went to New York City in the late 1950s to 1960 in search of opportunity. He started to teach Praying Mantis and by chance one of his kung fu brothers from Hong Kong also landed in New York and had a location for him to teach in New York's Manhattan Chinatown, where the exclusive club remains to this day. Over the years other students of Yip Shui slowly made their way to New York City. During the 1970s, Lee Kwun, Yip's brother-in-law and one of his earliest students, emigrated to New York and took over the 33f8b3169309f62b Praying Mantis club and continues to head it today, despite his advanced age. Today the club remains in its original location and is the first and oldest club in the country.\nForms.\nThere are many different forms in the 33f8b3169309f62b system and each instructor may teach a variety of forms. In addition to the solo forms, there are also numerous pair forms for empty hand and weapons, and many two-person drills (樁; Chong) to train techniques, sensitivity and power.\nThe names for some of the solo forms found in the system include:\nCore fist forms (拳種).\n33f8b3169309f62b Tong Long has a core set of basic forms that all instructors from different schools and lineages teach. The first 3 forms are known as the 拳種 or seed forms of the system and are usually the first 3 forms taught to beginner students to get them familiar with the correct mantis structure and shape. The next two forms in the list are also commonly taught by every school.\nIntermediate forms (中級).\n33f8b3169309f62b Tong Long has a modular syllabus, the names and order of forms may vary depending on the instructor. Some of these intermediate level forms have relatively short sequences and can be trained in combination with other sections. Here are the names for some of these forms:\nAdvanced forms (高級).\nHere are the names of some of these later advanced forms:\nQi Gong/Hay Gung Sets (氣功).\nThere are many internal energy (hay gung) exercises found in the system, which can be broadly put into 3 categories: 1/ exercises for maintaining health (養生功; yern sun gong), 2/ exercises for protecting the body from physical attacks (護體功; wu tai gong), 3/ exercises for developing the body and power for fighting (博擊功; bok gik gong).\nHere are the names of some of the key sets:\nWeapons (兵器).\nThe main weapon of choice in ",

He was a delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the United States Constitution. He served as DeWitt Clinton's running mate in the 1812 election, but Clinton and Ingersoll were defeated by James Madison and Elbridge Gerry.\nBorn in New Haven, Connecticut, Ingersoll established a legal career in Philadelphia after graduating from Yale College. The son of British colonial official 7a0ca31bdc53455e Sr., Ingersoll lived in Europe from 1773 to 1776 to avoid the growing political conflict between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. In 1778, having committed himself to the cause of American independence, Ingersoll returned to Philadelphia and won election to the Continental Congress. Ingersoll became convinced of the need for a stronger national government than what was provided by the Articles of Confederation, and he was a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention. Though he was initially seeking amendments for the Articles of Confederation, he eventually came to support the new Constitution that was produced by the convention.\nHe served as the Pennsylvania Attorney General from 1791 to 1800 and from 1811 to 1816. He also served as the United States Attorney for Pennsylvania and as the city solicitor for Philadelphia. He argued the cases of \"Chisholm v. Georgia\" and \"Hylton v. United States\", two of the first cases to appear before the United States Supreme Court.\nIngersoll affiliated with the Federalist Party and was deeply disturbed by Thomas Jefferson's victory in the 1800 presidential election. In 1812, the Democratic-Republican Party split between President Madison and Clinton. The Federalists decided to support a ticket of Clinton and Ingersoll in hopes of defeating the incumbent president. Madison prevailed in the election, winning Ingersoll's crucial home state of Pennsylvania.\nLife and career.\n7a0ca31bdc53455e was a supporter of the Revolutionary cause. His training as a lawyer convinced him that the problems of the newly independent states were caused by the inadequacy of the Articles of Confederation. He became an early and ardent proponent of constitutional reform, although, like a number of his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention, he believed this reform could be achieved by a simple revision of the Articles. Only after weeks of debate did he come to see that a new document was necessary. His major contribution to the cause of constitutional government came not during the Convention but later during a lengthy and distinguished legal career when he helped define many of the principles enunciated at Philadelphia.\nEarly life.\nBorn in New Haven, Connecticut, Ingersoll was the son of 7a0ca31bdc53455e Sr., a prominent British official whose strong Loyalist sentiments would lead to his being tarred and feathered by radical Patriots. In 1765, the year the Stamp Act was imposed on the colonies in America, the British Crown appointed the elder 7a0ca31bdc53455e as Stamp Master, the colonial agent in London, for the colony of Connecticut. As the next few months passed and animosity over the Stamp Act grew, Ingersoll became the most hated man in the colony. Between August 21 and 29, 1765, the Sons of Liberty hung his effigy in various parts of the colony. He wrote an account of Isaac Barre's speech made during the Parliamentary debate on the Stamp Act to Connecticut Governor Thomas Fitch. He would later be involved in a controversial role as the agent who enforced the resulting Stamp Act in Connecticut.\nThe younger Ingersoll completed Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven in 1762, graduated from Yale College in 1766, studied law in Philadelphia, and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1773. Although by training and inclination a Patriot sympathizer, the young Ingersoll shied away from the cause at the outset because of a strong sense of personal loyalty to his distinguished father. On his father's advice, he sought to escape the growing political controversy at home by retiring to London to continue his study of the law at the Middle Temple School (1773–1776) and to tour extensively through Europe. He spent more than eighteen months in Paris, where he formed an acquaintance with Benjamin Franklin.\nAmerican Revolution.\nShortly after the colonies declared their independence, Ingersoll renounced his family's views, made his personal commitment to the cause of independence, and returned home. In 1778 he arrived in Philadelphia as a confirmed Patriot. With the help of influential friends he quickly established a flourishing law practice, and shortly after he entered the fray as a delegate to the Continental Congress (1780–81). In 1781 Ingersoll married Elizabeth Pettit and in that same year was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. Always a supporter of strong central authority in political affairs, he became a leading agitator for reforming the national government in the postwar years, preaching the need for change to his friends in Congress and to the legal community.\nAt the Convention, Ingersoll was counted among those who favored revision of the existing Articles of Confederation, but in the end he joined with the majority and supported a plan for a new federal government. Despite his national reputation as an attorney, Ingersoll seldom participated in the Convention debates, although he attended all sessions.\nCareer after the Constitutional Convention.\nOnce the new national government was created, Ingersoll returned to the law. Except for a few excursions into politics—he was a member of Philadelphia's Common Council (1789), and, as a stalwart Federalist who considered the election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800 a \"great subversion,\" he ran unsuccessfully for vice president on the Federalist ticket in 1812—his public career centered on legal affairs. He served as attorney general of Pennsylvania (1790–1799 and 1811–1817), as Philadelphia's city solicitor (1798–1801), and as U.S. district attorney for Pennsylvania (1800–01). For a brief period (1821–22), he sat as presiding judge of the Philadelphia district court.\nIngersoll's major contribution to the cause of constitutional government came not during the Convention but later during a lengthy and distinguished legal career, when he helped define many of the principles enunciated at Philadelphia. He made his contributions to the Constitutional process through several Supreme Court cases that defined various basic points in Constitutional law during the beginning of the new republic. In one definitive case he represented Georgia in \"Chisholm v. Georgia\" (1793), a landmark case in states' rights. Here the court decided against him, ruling that a state may be sued in federal court by a citizen of another state. This reversal of the notion of state sovereignty was later rescinded by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. In representing Hylton in \"Hylton v. US\" (1796), Ingersoll was also involved in the first legal challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress. In this case, the Supreme Court upheld the government's right to impose a tax on carriages. Ingersoll also served as counsel in various cases that helped clarify constitutional issues concerning the jurisdiction of federal courts and U.S. relations with other sovereign nations, including defending Senator William Blount of Tennessee against impeachment.\nDeath and legacy.\n7a0ca31bdc53455e died in Philadelphia at age 73; interment was in the Old Pine Street Church Cemetery, Fourth and Pine Streets. Ingersoll was survived by three sons. Two of the sons, Charles 7a0ca31bdc53455e and Joseph Reed Ingersoll served as members of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

In the 1980s he formed the 375b8207144bfb42 Ensemble.\nHe had a long association with the Melbourne cultural support group and \"world music café\" The Boite, where he was a regular performer.\nFor many years he presented a weekly programme of Greek music for the community radio station 3ZZZ (mid 1990s to 2000). He also presented a programme for 3XY (late 1990s to his death).\nIn 2001 he produced a compilation CD for 3ZZZ funded by AMRAP. Of this he wrote: \"One of the most exciting activities for me last year was my involvement as producer in 3ZZZ’s CD \"Routes of Rhythm\", a compilation of six exciting and previously unrecorded Melbourne groups.\" This was followed by a second CD \"Routes of Rhythm 2\", which Costas also produced.\n375b8207144bfb42 died suddenly on 23 December 2004 aged 59. \"The Music of 375b8207144bfb42\", a feature that was produced for Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in 1985, was aired again on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation National Radio programme \"Music Deli\" as a tribute.

        "content": "The b104353f531a4106 (now Chiquita) was an American multinational corporation that traded in tropical fruit (primarily bananas) grown on Latin American plantations and sold in the United States and Europe. The company was formed in 1899 from the merger of the Boston Fruit Company with Minor C. Keith's banana-trading enterprises. It flourished in the early and mid-20th century, and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia and the West Indies. Although it competed with the Standard Fruit Company (later Dole Food Company) for dominance in the international banana trade, it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions, some of which came to be called banana republics – such as Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala.\nUnited Fruit had a deep and long-lasting impact on the economic and political development of several Latin American countries. Critics often accused it of exploitative neocolonialism, and they described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a multinational corporation on the internal politics of the so-called banana republics. After a period of financial decline, United Fruit was merged with Eli M. Black's AMK in 1970 to become the United Brands Company. In 1984, Carl Lindner, Jr. transformed United Brands into the present-day Chiquita Brands International.\nCorporate history.\nEarly years.\nIn 1871, U.S. railroad entrepreneur Henry Meiggs signed a contract with the government of Costa Rica to build a railroad connecting the capital city of San José to the port of Limón in the Caribbean. Meiggs was assisted in the project by his young nephew, Minor C. Keith, who took over Meiggs's business concerns in Costa Rica after his death in 1877. Keith began experimenting with the planting of bananas as a cheap source of food for his workers.\nWhen the Costa Rican government defaulted on its payments in 1882, Keith had to borrow £1.2 million from London banks and from private investors to continue the difficult engineering project. In exchange for this and for renegotiating Costa Rica's own debt, in 1884, the administration of President Próspero Fernández Oreamuno agreed to give Keith of tax-free land along the railroad, plus a 99-year lease on the operation of the train route. The railroad was completed in 1890, but the flow of passengers proved insufficient to finance Keith's debt. However, the sale of bananas grown in his lands and transported first by train to Limón, then by ship to the United States, proved very lucrative. Keith eventually came to dominate the banana trade in Central America and along the Caribbean coast of Colombia.\nUnited Fruit (1899–1970).\nIn 1899, Keith lost $1.5 million when Hoadley and Co., a New York City broker, went bankrupt. He then traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, to participate in the merger of his banana trading company, Tropical Trading and Transport Company, with the rival Boston Fruit Company. Boston Fruit had been established by Lorenzo Dow Baker, a sailor who, in 1870, had bought his first bananas in Jamaica, and by Andrew W. Preston. Preston's lawyer, Bradley Palmer, had devised a scheme for the solution of the participants' cash flow problems and was in the process of implementing it. \nThe merger formed the b104353f531a4106, based in Boston, with Preston as president and Keith as vice-president. Palmer became a permanent member of the executive committee and for long periods of time the director. From a business point of view, Bradley Palmer was United Fruit. Preston brought to the partnership his plantations in the West Indies, a fleet of steamships, and his market in the U.S. Northeast. Keith brought his plantations and railroads in Central America and his market in the U.S. South and Southeast. At its founding, United Fruit was capitalized at $11.23 million. The company at Palmer's direction proceeded to buy, or buy a share in, 14 competitors, assuring them of 80% of the banana import business in the United States, then their main source of income. The company catapulted into financial success. Bradley Palmer overnight became a much-sought-after expert in business law, as well as a wealthy man. He later became a consultant to presidents and an adviser to Congress.\nIn 1900, the b104353f531a4106 produced \"The Golden Caribbean: A Winter Visit to the Republics of Colombia, Costa Rica, Spanish Honduras, Belize and the Spanish Main – via Boston and New Orleans\" written and illustrated by Henry R. Blaney. The travel book featured landscapes and portraits of the inhabitants pertaining to the regions where the b104353f531a4106 possessed land. It also described the voyage of the b104353f531a4106's steamer, and Blaney's descriptions and encounters of his travels.\nIn 1901, the government of Guatemala hired the b104353f531a4106 to manage the country's postal service, and in 1913 the b104353f531a4106 created the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company. By 1930, it had absorbed more than 20 rival firms, acquiring a capital of $215 million and becoming the largest employer in Central America. In 1930, Sam Zemurray (nicknamed \"Sam the Banana Man\") sold his Cuyamel Fruit Company to United Fruit and retired from the fruit business. By then, the company held a major role in the national economies of several countries and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy. This led to serious labor disputes by the Costa Rican peasants, involving more than 30 separate unions and 100,000 workers, in the 1934 Great Banana Strike, one of the most significant actions of the era by trade unions in Costa Rica.\nBy the 1930s the company owned of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase \"banana republic\".\nIn 1933, concerned that the company was mismanaged and that its market value had plunged, Zemurray staged a hostile takeover. Zemurray moved the company's headquarters to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was based. United Fruit went on to prosper under Zemurray's management; Zemurray resigned as president of the company in 1951.\nIn addition to many other labor actions, the company faced two major strikes of workers in South and Central America, in Colombia in 1928 and the Great Banana Strike of 1934 in Costa Rica. The latter was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective trade unions in Costa Rica since the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938. Labor laws in most banana production countries began to be tightened in the 1930s. b104353f531a4106 saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms, and often refused to negotiate with strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws.\nIn 1952, the government of Guatemala began expropriating unused ",

United Fruit had far less cash than Black had counted on, and Black's mismanagement led to United Brands becoming crippled with debt. The company's losses were exacerbated by Hurricane Fifi in 1974, which destroyed many banana plantations in Honduras.

On May 19, \"c5f9abe910f35fd6\" was announced for release in August. In addition, the album's track listing was revealed. In August, the band went on a tour of the US with Hellogoodbye, Limbeck and My Favorite Highway. \"c5f9abe910f35fd6\" was released on August 25 through Nettwerk. Two of the bonus tracks are re-imagined versions of songs on the CD, and two are remixes. The title of the album comes from a line of the lyrics on the track \"Light a Roman Candle with Me\". Following a support slot for Motion City Soundtrack, Fun supported Paramore on their headlining US tour in April and May.\nReception.\n\"c5f9abe910f35fd6\" was released to positive reviews. AbsolutePunk.net's Drew Beringer praised the album, calling it \"what a pop album \"should\" sound like\" and \"the most essential pop album of 2009\". AllMusic called the album \"progressive, but in the best possible way\" and admired Ruess's lyrics for \"investigating the larger truths of life...with a witty approach that keeps the songs bubbling merrily along on a positive note\". Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic wrote, \"\"c5f9abe910f35fd6\" isn’t the most consistent pop album around,\" but he ultimately commended the album as \"a superbly mixed and arranged album made by musicians who clearly understand the limits and potential of pop music\".\nEstella Hung of \"PopMatters\" was less impressed with the album, praising songs \"Be Calm\" and \"The Gambler\", but criticizing the lyrics and production of the album's early tracks. Hung concluded that while \"",

Shane applauded the album's songwriting and said \"many of the songs are really good\", but he objected to the \"cute\" production, desiring to hear the band \"in a more stripped-down form. He ended his review with: \"I have a similar problem with Dr. Dog, a band that was recommended to me by a number of people. I think much of their recorded work is too fussed over, but when I saw them live and their sound was more stripped down out of necessity, emphasizing their powerful songwriting, I thought they were wonderful.

Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.\nWhen a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. If the charge moves, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.\n909bb29ac3f83385 is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. 909bb29ac3f83385's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.\nHistory.\nLong before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\n909bb29ac3f83385 would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote \"De Magnete\", in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word \"electricus\" (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\", from ἤλεκτρον, \"elektron\", the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. ",

Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. \nConcepts.\nElectric charge",

With the voices of Mel Blanc, Michael Bell, Arlene Golonka, and Phil Luther Jr., the show follows an orange anthropomorphic dune buggy who alongside teenagers Debbie, Mark, and Tinker, solves mysteries while participating in racing competitions around the world. The series was produced by Iwao Takamoto, executive produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, and directed by Charles A. Nichols.\nThe series was originally developed under the working titles \"Speed Bug\" and \"Speed Buggs\" before \"c2bf102693a376f8\" was settled on. Takamoto was less involved with the series due to the trust he had for storyboard and animation artist Bob Singer. The concept for the show was inspired by the 1968 Walt Disney Pictures film \"The Love Bug\" and the \"Speed Racer\" anime franchise. Several of the story lines and plots originated on Hanna-Barbera's other animated series \"Josie and the Pussycats\".\n\"c2bf102693a376f8\" lasted for one season with a total of 16 episodes. Despite its short run, it was broadcast on the Big Three television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television, often replacing quickly-cancelled new cartoons. Critical response to \"c2bf102693a376f8\" was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", while others found it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.\nPremise.\nSet in an assortment of locations around the world, the series follows three teenagers (Mark, Debbie, and Tinker) and a talking dune buggy as they partake in various adventures. c2bf102693a376f8, the dune buggy, was designed by Tinker and participates in racing competitions in order to collect winner's trophies. During their travels, the crew often defeats villains and crooks in order to save the world, such as diamond thieves, car-obsessed doctors, and evil pirates. Known as the \"Speed Buggs\", the group of three teenagers is able to activate c2bf102693a376f8 through the use of a portable walkie-talkie. Several episodes in the series feature reworked versions of story lines from Hanna-Barbera's \"Josie and the Pussycats\".\nCharacters.\nThe series features the following four main characters throughout its run:\nProduction and creation.\n\"c2bf102693a376f8\" was developed with the working titles \"Speed Bug\" and \"Speed Buggs\". The show's concept was partly inspired by the 1968 Walt Disney Pictures film \"The Love Bug\" and the Japanese \"Speed Racer\" franchise. It was hinted by author David Hofstede that \"Chugga-Boom\", the vehicle in Hanna-Barbera's series \"The Perils of Penelope Pitstop\", served as a prototype for the vehicle in \"c2bf102693a376f8\". Executive produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's Hanna-Barbera Productions, Charles A. Nichols served as the director and Art Scott was the associate producer. Iwao Takamoto, the main producer, expressed in his posthumous 2009 autobiography that the creation of \"c2bf102693a376f8\" occurred due to the success of his other productions \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\". He wrote that his participation in the series was partly because he enjoyed getting \"[his] hands on a show whenever [he] felt it was necessary\"; however, he was ultimately less involved with the show due to his trust with Bob Singer, an animation artist for Hanna-Barbera productions at the time.\nJack Mendelshon and Chuck Menville were the two head writers for the episodes. Several other writers contributed to the series, including Lars Bourne, Len Janson, Joel Kane, Jack Kaplan, Woody Kling, Norman Maurer, and Larry Rhine. The main title theme for \"c2bf102693a376f8\" was copyrighted in November 1975; it was composed by Hoyt Curtin under the supervision of Paul DeKorte. Besides the lead roles, other voice actors involved with the series include Janet Waldo, Hal Smith, John Stephenson, and Mike Road.\nReception.\nBroadcast history.\n\"c2bf102693a376f8\" was broadcast on CBS as part of their Saturday morning children's lineup between September 8 and December 22, 1973. Before being cancelled, it continued to air regularly until August 31, 1974. After its original run, CBS included reruns of \"c2bf102693a376f8\" in their children-oriented television blocks, it was broadcast from February 4, 1978, to September 2, 1978, and September 18, 1982, to January 29, 1983. It also played on both ABC and NBC, when they acquired syndication rights for the series. ABC aired it at noon in from September 6, 1975, to September 4, 1976. When NBC abruptly cancelled \"McDuff, the Talking Dog\" after its November 20, 1976 run, \"c2bf102693a376f8\" aired on NBC in reruns from November 27, 1976, to September , 1977. According to \"The A.V. Club\"s Will Harris, the series was successful and had a large fan base because it aired on all three major television networks in the 1970s.\nDuring the 1980s, the series was rerun as part of the USA Network's \"USA Cartoon Express\" block, and Cartoon Network has broadcast \"c2bf102693a376f8\" on several occasions since its initial launch in 1992. As part of a Valentine's Day event in February 2007, sister channel Boomerang aired the program alongside other cartoons such as \"Tom and Jerry\", \"The Jetsons\", and \"Dexter's Laboratory\". The episode \"c2bf102693a376f8 Went That-a-Way\" was featured on the Warner Bros. Presents DVD compilation \"Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1970's Volume 1\" and released on May 26, 2009. As part of the Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's Archive Collection, the complete \"c2bf102693a376f8\" series was made available on DVD as a four-disc set.\nCritical response.\nIn retrospective reviews, critics saw the series as similar to the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise. Aubrey Sitterson of Geek.com included \"c2bf102693a376f8\" on their unranked list of \"favorite Scooby-Doo knockoffs\". He noted similarities between Speedy and Scooby-Doo's \"Mystery Machine\", and joked that Tinker is \"basically just Shaggy in a jumpsuit\". However, he hinted that \"c2bf102693a376f8\"s success could have been derived from its shared storylines as seen on \"Josie and the Pussycats\". Similarly, Harris from \"The A.V. Club\" agreed and wrote that the main difference between the two shows was that \"c2bf102693a376f8\" \"substitut[ed] racing for rock 'n' roll\". He also claimed that the main character \"confirm[ed] that sidekicks don't always have to be animals\". \"c2bf102693a376f8\" and the Scooby-Doo gang would be featured in a crossover episode (\"The Weird Winds of Winona\") in the second installment of the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise, \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" (1972-1973).\nSeveral comparisons were made between the show and other works created by Hanna-Barbera. David Mansour, author of \"From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century\", wrote in his book that \"c2bf102693a376f8\" shared several characteristics with Hanna-Barbera's \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\". He speculated that Mark was the \"Freddy-esque handsome brain\", Debbie was the \"Daphne-esque pretty girlfriend\", and Tinker was the \"Shaggy-esque mechanic and driver\". Furthermore, he considered c2bf102693a376f8 to be one of the most \"famous dune buggies of pop culture\" alongside the buggies in \"The Funky Phantom\", \"The Banana Splits\", and the Big Jim toy line. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of \"15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s You Used to Love\". On a more negative note, author David Perlmutter found Hanna-Barbera's use of \"humanized automobiles\" to be too predictable and repetitive.\nLegacy.\n\"",

Initially, the centre was popular for festival style public shows which featured some retail exhibitors, Circus shows and concerts for a duration of three weeks each in winter months. Fred imported large marquis from the USA to provide for the exhibition space and a Circus tent with a seating capacity of 1200 in addition to an open air arena for various acrobatic performances.

His intention was to receive a blessing prior to his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. For the next two centuries the meadow belonged to nuns, who in 1366 exchanged it with the city's authorities for a manor at Florianska Street. The meadow was used by peasants from neighboring villages to graze their cattle.\nUntil the 19th century 604caf21ecb8b110 Park was largely neglected, and often flooded by the Rudawa river in the spring turning it into wetland with small islands, probably contributing to the spread of epidemics. After draining the swamps, 604caf21ecb8b110 became perfectly suitable to host large gatherings. In 1809, when the city was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw, 604caf21ecb8b110 was a place of salute of the troops of Napoleon, organized by Prince Jozef Poniatowski and General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. \nToday 604caf21ecb8b110 is a recreation area, frequently hosting large events like concerts and exhibitions.

Its straight northern boundary is formed by the ancient Wool Street, separating it from Fulbourn, and its eastern border follows the Icknield Way (now the A11), separating it from Little Abington. The remaining boundaries with Stapleford, Sawston and Pampisford are formed by field boundaries and a small section of the River Granta, on which the village lies.\nThe course of the River Granta through the parish has been changed on numerous occasions; a watermill was listed as valueless in the 14th century when the river had changed course, and additional water channels have been dug for irrigation as well as to form an ornamental canal alongside 99c232e02fa84438 Hall. Severe floods hit 99c232e02fa84438 in both 1655 and 1749.\nTraces of a Roman villa have been found on its parish boundary with Stapleford. It has also been suggested that the village has moved site, the principal evidence being that the church is from the present village. 99c232e02fa84438 was comparatively wealthy during medieval times due to its wool trade, with the highest tax returns in its hundred. In the late 16th century the manor was the principal seat of the great Elizabethan merchant and financier Sir Horatio Palavicino. Between 1632 and the 19th century, the manor was owned by the Bennet, and later the Adeane, families, who lived in 99c232e02fa84438 Hall. The Hall was built in 1833 by Henry John Adeane.\nListed as \"Badburgham\" in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village's name means \"homestead or village of a woman called Beaduburh\". This version of the name was also used in the 15th century, as the home village of an ostler called Roger Baldok, in a Plea Roll of the Court of Common Pleas.\nJohn Hullier was vicar of the parish of 99c232e02fa84438 from 1549 until he was deprived in February 1556.

The antiquary William Cole lived in 99c232e02fa84438 as a child when his father was the steward of the owners of 99c232e02fa84438 Hall. In the 19th century 99c232e02fa84438 was home to Jonas Webb, a noted stock breeder who played a pivotal role in developing the Southdown breed of sheep.\nChurch.\nThere was probably a church in the village at the time of the Norman Conquest, though the first official record was in the late 12th century. The present parish church, dedicated to St Peter since the 12th century, consists of a chancel, an aisled and clerestoried nave with north and south porches, and a west tower. There are two bells in the tower, both from 1614. The smaller weighs 11cwt and is cracked; the larger 13cwt.\nThe chancel and lower part of the tower date from the 13th century though there is evidence of an earlier building. The nave was completely rebuilt in the 15th century.\nVillage life.\nThe village contains a primary school called 99c232e02fa84438 Primary School, which opened in 1959. It also retains one public house, The George, which was already open as an inn in 1488 but rebuilt in around 1600. There have been inns listed in the village from the 13th century, presumably on the Icknield Way at Bourn Bridge. Other former inns include The Angel, listed in 1490, The Swan, open in the 16th century, and The Chequer and The Griffin, all four of which were still open in 1600. Three ale-house licences were awarded to the village in 1682.\n99c232e02fa84438 village cricket team won the Cambridgeshire Cricket Association Senior League in 2008.\n99c232e02fa84438 in literature.\nF.

The movie aired in the United States of America on July 21, 2012 at 8pm. \"9e74ab4dd19a94fc\" has received six award nominations, winning two of these awards.\nPlot.\nRussell Williams (Gary Cole), known to friends and family as 'Russ', is a Colonel in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He is promoted to base commander at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, and celebrates the promotion with his wife, Mary Elizabeth Harriman (Nahanni Johnstone), at her charity fundraiser. Both Russ and Mary are well-respected members of their small community of Tweed, Ontario. The night after the charity event, a hooded man breaks into a young girl's room while she is away with family, stealing underwear, bras, and a picture of the girl at the beach. This intruder is given a face in the next break-in. It is revealed that Russell is the perpetrator after he steals underwear and sex toys, and hides in a woman's closet while she returns to her house at night. Russ leaves her a message on her computer screen before he exits the house, using poor grammar in an attempt to throw any potential investigators off his trail.\nThroughout the movie, Russ becomes increasingly daring and his crimes escalate from breaking and entering, to sexual assault, to rape, and eventually murder. With the town having labelled the responsible party as the \"Tweed Creeper\", Russ takes every opportunity to express how disgusting he thinks this man's actions are. Nobody is suspicious of the Trenton base commander.\nDetective Jennifer Dobson, a local police officer, teams up with Toronto Detective Nick Gallagher - who is on exchange in Tweed - to investigate the series of breaking and entering cases. They follow Russ's trail through many assaults, as well as the murder of Corporal Marie-France Comeau, a non-commissioned member (NCM) under the Colonel's command. The detectives' big break comes when Dobson is driving around on patrol and spots a vehicle parked in a field next to a house. She does a quick investigation, and when she finds nobody home, she moves on. When the woman who lived in that house, Jessica Lloyd, is reported missing and the SUV is gone, the police launch an investigation into the vehicle. Through the use of traffic checkpoints, the police match the treads of the tires to the vehicle of Colonel Williams. The detectives devise a plan to call Russ in with the story of needing his help in the cold case. He willingly complies and agrees to answer some routine questions. Russell removes his boots in the hallway, and while he is in the interrogation room with Detective Gallagher, Detective Dobson runs his boot prints. When they match those found on the scenes of the crimes, two teams are deployed to search Russell's Tweed home and his office at the Trenton Base. The panties and bras are found, alongside a staggering amount of photo and video evidence, and a record of all the undergarments he had stolen.\nIn the interrogation room, Gallagher switches from small talk and easy questions to a more serious and invasive line of questioning. Eventually, Dobson joins Gallagher and they inform Russell Williams of all the evidence they found against him. The detectives coax a confession out of the Colonel and he is stripped of his title and his medals. His wife, his friends, his remaining victims, and his community are left to deal with the repercussions, as well as the 3000 military personnel who were under his command.\nReception.\nAwards.\n\"9e74ab4dd19a94fc\" was nominated for:\n\"9e74ab4dd19a94fc\" won:\nReviews.\nThere are mixed reviews regarding \"9e74ab4dd19a94fc.\" The film's writer, Keith Ross Leckie, defended the movie against critics claiming it was insensitive and ignored the facts in favour of sensationalizing the story. Leckie told The Star that they were very careful in how they went about the making of \"",

Police, victims, and families of victims were all contacted before writing began, and Leckie went to the houses where the attacks occurred so he could tell the story with as much accuracy and empathy as possible.\nThe Huffington Post published an article boldly titled \"Why Canadians Should Reject The Russell Williams Crime Movie,\" in which they proclaim that it is a sensationalistic movie created solely for profit, and that it \"stains the good honour of Canadian women and men in uniform.\" While citing all the inaccuracies and dramatizations throughout the film, Huffington Post professes that the only parts recreated with precision accuracy are the assaults, rapes, and murders of his victims, forcing them to relive the horrors they are trying to leave behind",

They are party to Treaty Six and had the Buck Lake Indian Reserve 133C and Wabamun Lake Indian Reserve 133A, 133B and 133C allocated to them by the federal government in 1892. However, the Buck Lake Reserve was decimated by the Spanish Flu of 1918 and is now largely abandoned.\nAs of 2005, the nation had 1,926 members, of which 1,110 lived on-reserve.\neb6f090e9bf64605's Wabamun 133A and 133B lands are located along Lake Wabumun, approximately west of Edmonton. The lake is a popular destination for Alberta to spend weekends and holidays, and the band operates the Ironhead Golf and Country Club to appeal to this market.\nIn April 2010, there was a devastating costly wildfire that caused community members to flee.\nDemographics.\nThe eb6f090e9bf64605 signed a treaty in 1876 and settled on the eastern edge of Lake Wabamun. While the total population of the eb6f090e9bf64605 was 1397, 856 individuals were living on the eb6f090e9bf64605 Reserve in 1996. By 1998 there were 1,400 members of the Paul First Nation. The majority were Stoney and the remainder Cree. In Alberta the Nakoda were known as Stoney. They were also grouped by the Cree term Assiniboine. They all speak common Siouan language but according to Bird, \"there are differences in dialects spoken between the groups in Alberta and also between those in Alberta and those in Saskatchewan and Montana.\"\nHistory.\nThe Stoney are descendants of individual bands of Dakota, Lakota and Nakota, in particular of western groups of Assiniboine, from which they spun out as an independent group at about 1744. The Stoney were divided geographically and culturally into two tribal groups or divisions with different dialects, which in turn were further divided into several bands.\nOf all the Siouan speaking groups, the eb6f090e9bf64605 and the Alexis Band were the farthest north and west. In her thesis Ruby Bird, daughter of then Chief Bird, summarized Andersen's three possibilities regarding the Paul and Alexis' Bands in pre-treaty times,\nBy 1880, about a half of the Alexis Band led by Ironhead separated and were living at Wabamun Lake where the land and fishing was better than the lands assigned to the Alexis band as a reserve when they signed Treaty Six in 1876. The chief of the Alexis Band was Catholic and was not tolerant of other religions. The Wabamum Lake band were Protestant.\nBy 1892, the federal government realized the two bands, the Alexis and the Wabamun Lake band had irreconcilable differences and therefore created a second reserve for the eb6f090e9bf64605 settled at White Whale Lake. The reserve name was changed to Wabamun Lake Indian Reserve. eb6f090e9bf64605 was named after the head man at the time. According to government documents, Paul's brother Ironhead, had led them to Wabamun Lake, but Ironhead died before the reserve was officially founded. The reserve was called Wabamun Lake Indian Reserve and the Band was called eb6f090e9bf64605. Eventually the popular name for the reserve became eb6f090e9bf64605.\nWabamun Lake.\nIronhead had moved his band to Wabamun Lake by 1880 because the fishing was good there. There are rolling aspen hills and good land surrounding the lake.\nStarting around 1850, the mission at Lac Ste. Anne began fishing nearby lakes to provide fish to customers in Edmonton.\nBy 2003, the lake was described as one of the most heavily used lakes in Alberta by limnologist David Schindler. It is also one of the most popular recreational lakes in Alberta.\neb6f090e9bf64605 First Nation Reserve is on the east end of the lake. There is a village, Wabamun, and a number of summer villages and subdivisions on the lake shore. The Yellowhead Highway and CNR railroad tracks parallel the north shore. There are coal mines north and south of the lake as well as TransAlta's Wabamun (now decommissioned) and Sundance power plants and cooling ponds for the Sundance and Keephills power plants. There is Wabamun Lake Provincial Park at Moonlight Bay and a golf course managed by the eb6f090e9bf64605 First Nation Reserve.\nSince 1912, Lake Wabamun water levels have been \"repeatedly and illegally modified\" by \"different groups wishing to regulate lake levels at either very high or very low levels.\"\nTwenty two percent of the catchment basin of Lake Wabamun has been disturbed by two coal mines, the Highvale, covering 12,600 hectares, the largest coal mine in Canada and the Whitewood mine. Strip mining involves remove overburden to expose the coal seam that is then mined in distinct strips. By 2004, these two mines had disturbed 5,593 ha of the Lake Wabamun catch basin.\nThe vast majority of the coal burning in Alberta occurs approximately 70 km west of Edmonton, in the Wabumun Lake area. The Wabamun Generating Station, a coal fired plant owned by TransAlta, located next to the village of Wabamun, Alberta was first commissioned in 1956 and decommissioned in 2010 with the smoke stacks demolished in March 2011. The station's primary source of fuel was sub bituminous from the Whitewood mine.\nAccording to CASA and cited in David Schindler's 2003 report commissioned by Alberta Environment the combined emissions of the coal-fired plants in the Wabumun Lake area, emitted,\nAlthough mercury levels in fish for consumption meet guidelines for occasional use, Schindler cautioned that for the eb6f090e9bf64605 subsistence consumers some concern remains in the consumption of large pike that exceed mercury levels in Lake Wabamun.\nOn 3 August 2005 more than of bunker oil and other chemicals spilled into Lake Wabamun when faulty tracks caused 40 rail cars to derail in the Wabumun village. Two years later there were health cautions still issued, warning users of the Lake to avoid oil patches and tar balls in Lake Wabamun.\nEducation.\nIn the summer of 1893 the White Whale Lake Methodist Day School was opened at eb6f090e9bf64605 reserve run by the resident Methodist missionary. In the fall of 1893 the Methodist Church began operating the Red Deer Methodist Indian Industrial School.\neb6f090e9bf64605 school age children attended the Edmonton Residential School and the St Albert Residential School approximately between the years 1923 and 1950.\nSocial issues.\nIn an interview with elder Alexie Simon, published in the 1998 Bird thesis, Simon claimed that ",

He signed with the North American electronic dance record label Ultra Music in 2013 and left his own label in 2015. Since June 2017, he officially returned to the Hardstyle community at the closing ceremony of \"Defqon.1 Weekend Festival 2017\".\nIn 2018, a0ec5455d8f09ebf and fellow DJ Wildstylez started a new Hardstyle label called: \"Art of Creation\".\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nWillem Rebergen was born on 12 September 1985 in Veenendaal, Netherlands. From an early age Rebergen had an interest in music. Having struggled with bullying at school, Rebergen looked for a distraction to make himself happy and so joined a local kid's choir. Here he had his first exposure to a professional studio, recording Christmas albums with the choir. This experience left Rebergen interested and inspired by the process of creating music from the other side of the studio. In 2003, while working at a clothing store he was offered tickets to Qlimax from friends who could not attend. This was his first exposure to hardstyle music. This experience gave him the impetus to forge a music career and in his own words from then on he was \"devoted to hardstyle and from that point interested in how to make the music. I wanted to make that kind of music.\"\nHe purchased some turntables and connected them to his mixer practicing his DJing, while simultaneously making music in FL Studio, a digital audio workstation. Rebergen began sending demos out to labels under the alias Nasty D-Tuners, a duo project he formed with close friend Bobby van Putten. In 2004 Nasty D-Tuners entered and won the Defqon.1 DJ contest, winning a spot on that year's lineup.\nRebergen and van Putten heard of a new hard dance music label \"Hardcontrol\", that was opening in Veenendaal. In 2005, a year and a half after their performance at Defqon 2004, Nasty D-Tuners were signed to Hardcontrol Records having two successful releases, with their work being played by then major Hardstyle producers/DJ's. Also in 2005, Rebergen and van Putten began attending a DJ class at the Rock Academy in the Netherlands. Rebergen found his time at the academy frustrating, due to a lack of encouragement towards producing Hardstyle and negative responses to the genre as a whole. Alienated by his experience at the Academy, Rebergen continued to send out Nasty D-Tuners demos to respective labels, one eventually reaching Scantraxx founder, Dov Elkabas (The Prophet). Seeing promise in the young duo, having heard of their performance at Defqon.1, 'Nasty D-Tuners' were signed to Scantraxx in late 2005. Unable to keep the alias 'Nasty D-Tuners' due to disagreements with the former label, the name \"a0ec5455d8f09ebf\" was chosen. By the end of 2005, Rebergen and van Putten had performed at major hardstyle events including Defqon.1, Q-Base and The Prophet's X-Qlusive, all of which increased their profile within the Hardstyle scene.\n2006-2007: \"Scantraxx\" &amp; the beginning of \"a0ec5455d8f09ebf\".\nThe year 2006 saw the first a0ec5455d8f09ebf release \"Aiming for Your Brain/ Left Some Answers\", on Scantraxx Special. Their debut release was followed by \"The Sacrifice/D-Tuned\", again on Scantraxx Special. \"The Sacrifice\" was the duo's most successful hit to date, Rebergen since stating his fond memories of the positive reception that The Prophet gave him the first time he heard it. Problems soon began to emerge when Rebergen came to the conclusion that he would be unable to perform and record for Scantraxx while simultaneously completing his course at the Rock Academy. Rebergen told van Putten of his decision to leave the Academy and hoped he would join and commit himself to a0ec5455d8f09ebf and Scantraxx. van Putten then made the difficult decision to leave Rebergen, Scantraxx and a0ec5455d8f09ebf and continue with his musical studies at the Rock Academy.

Their First song \"Blame It On the Music / Project 1\" released in March and proved a success. It also provided the impetus for the launch of a new project and debut album for the pair, \"Project One\". Finishing in under three months, producing an average of one track a week, a0ec5455d8f09ebf and Wildstylez completed their 13 track debut album, \"a0ec5455d8f09ebf &amp; Wildstylez Present: Project One\".

To audition, contestants who lived in America had to send videos in to the YOMYOMF crew, who then narrowed them down to the top 100. At the Los Angeles Center Studios, Higa and Lakin then eliminated many of those contestants to get a top ten. Those ten contestants were then due to make a new specific type of video every day until there was only two contestants left. Throughout the judging in the competition, there were various guest judges, many of which were popular YouTube personalities, including Andrew Garcia, Dominic Sandoval, Joe Penna, Dave Days, Kassem G, Jenna Marbles, Brice Beckham and David Fickas.\nThe final showdown was between Lana McKissack, a solo female contestant, and the Brothers Riedell, consisting of Chris and Nick Riedell, who had consistently been a favourite contestant with the judges.

For the second season, contestants from America and Canada sent their videos into the YOMYOMF crew, who again narrowed it down to the top 100. However, unlike the first season, the contestants had to show an original video in front of the judges, who then immediately determined whether they would continue in the competition or would be eliminated. It was noted, that during this preliminary round of 100 contestants, the judges' comments were mostly positive, with inter-judge occurring infrequently.\nAfter many eliminations, the judges finally narrowed the contestants down to the top 10. Like the first season, these ten contestants then went on to create different types of videos until they were narrowed down to the top three. Like the first season, there were many guest judges throughout the competition, including Wong Fu Productions, Phillip DeFranco, Kassem G, the Fine Brothers, Shane Dawson, Justine Ezarik, Smosh, Jenna Marbles and PewDiePie.

It is the capital city, and largest city, of the autonomous region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, one of two autonomous regions which are not subdivided into provinces.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4 is located at the head of the Gulf of 1dedf37c92f33ff4, on a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia; Slovenia lies approximately east and southeast of the city, while Croatia is about to the south of the city.\nThe city has a long coastline and is surrounded by grassland, forest, and karstic areas. The city has a subtropical climate, unusual in relation to its relatively high latitude, due to marine breezes. In 2022, it had a population of about 204,302. 1dedf37c92f33ff4 is the capital of the autonomous region of Friuli Venezia Giulia and was previously capital of the Province of 1dedf37c92f33ff4, until its abolition on 1 October 2017.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4 belonged to the Habsburg monarchy from 1382 until 1918. In the 19th century the monarchy was one of the Great Powers of Europe and 1dedf37c92f33ff4 was its most important seaport. As a prosperous trading hub in the Mediterranean region, 1dedf37c92f33ff4 became the fourth largest city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (after Vienna, Budapest, and Prague). In the \"fin de siècle\" period it emerged as an important hub for literature and music. 1dedf37c92f33ff4 underwent an economic revival during the 1930s, and the Free Territory of 1dedf37c92f33ff4 became a major site of the struggle between the Eastern and Western blocs after the Second World War.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4, a deep-water port, is a maritime gateway for northern Italy, Germany, Austria and Central Europe. It is considered the end point of the maritime Silk Road, with its connections to the Suez Canal and Turkey. Since the 1960s, 1dedf37c92f33ff4 has emerged as a prominent research location in Europe because of its many international organisations and institutions. The city lies at the intersection of Latin, Slavic and Germanic cultures where Central Europe meets the Mediterranean Sea, and is home to diverse ethnic groups and religious communities.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4 has the highest percentage of researchers in Europe in relation to population. \"Città della Barcolana\", \"Città della bora\", \"Città del vento\", \"Vienna by the sea\" and \"City of coffee\" are also idioms used to describe 1dedf37c92f33ff4.\nNames and etymology.\nThe most likely origin is a Celtic word, \"Tergeste\" – with the \"-est-\" suffix typical of Venetic – and derived from the hypothetical Illyrian word \"*terg-\" \"market\" (etymologically cognate to the Albanian term 'market, marketplace' and reconstructed Proto-Slavic \"*tъrgъ\") Roman authors also transliterated the name as \"Tergestum\" (according to Strabo, the name of the \"oppidum\" Tergestum originated from the three battles the Roman Army had to engage in with local tribes, \"TER GESTUM [BELLUM]\"). Modern names of the city include: , , , , , , \"Tergésti\" and .\nGeography.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4 lies in the northernmost part of the high Adriatic in northeastern Italy, near the border with Slovenia. The city lies on the Gulf of 1dedf37c92f33ff4. Built mostly on a hillside that becomes a mountain, 1dedf37c92f33ff4's urban territory lies at the foot of an imposing escarpment that comes down abruptly from the Karst Plateau towards the sea. The karst hills delimiting the city reach an elevation of above sea level. It lies at the junction point of the Italian geographical region, the Balkan Peninsula, and Mitteleuropan Area.\nClimate.\nThe territory of 1dedf37c92f33ff4 is composed of several different climate zones depending on the distance from the sea and elevation. The average temperatures (1971–2000) are in January and in July. It has a humid subtropical climate (according to the Köppen climate classification). On average, humidity levels are low (~65%), while only two months (January and February) receive slightly less than of precipitation.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4, like the Istrian Peninsula, has evenly distributed rainfall above in total; it is noteworthy that no true summer drought occurs. Snow occurs on average 0–2 days per year. Temperatures are very mild; lows below 0° are somewhat rare and highs above are not common. Maximum Winter highs are lower than the average temperatures in the Mediterranean zone (~ 5–11 °C) but with quite high minimums (~2–8 °C). Two basic weather patterns alternate — sunny, windy and often very cold days frequently caused a northeastern wind called \"Bora\", as well as rainy days with temperatures of about . Summer is very warm with highs of about and lows above , with hot nights being influenced by the warm sea water. The highest temperature of the last 30 years is in 2020, whereas the absolute minimum was in 1996.\nThe 1dedf37c92f33ff4 area is divided into 8a–10a zones according to USDA hardiness zoning; Villa Opicina (320 to 420 MSL) with \"8a\" in upper suburban area down to \"10a\" in especially shielded and windproof valleys close to the Adriatic sea.\nThe climate can be severely affected by the \"Bora\", a very dry and usually cool north-to-northeast katabatic wind that can last for some days and reach speeds of up to on the piers of the port, thus sometimes bringing subzero temperatures to the entire city.\nCity districts.\n1dedf37c92f33ff4 is administratively divided in seven districts, which in turn are further subdivided into parishes (\"frazioni\"):\nThe iconic city centre is Piazza Unità d'Italia, which is located in between the large 19th-century avenues (Borgo Teresiano) and the old medieval city, composed of many narrow streets.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nSince the second millennium BC, the location was an inhabited site. Originally an Illyrian settlement, the Veneti entered the region in the 10th–9th c. BC and seem to have given the town its name, \"Tergeste\", since \"terg*\" is a Venetic word meaning market (q.v. Oderzo whose ancient name was \"Opitergium\"). Later, the town was captured by the Carni, a tribe of the Eastern Alps, before becoming part of the Roman republic in 177 BC during the Second Istrian War.\nAfter being attacked by barbarians from the interior in 52 BC, until 46 BC it was granted the status of Roman colony under Julius Caesar, who recorded its name as \"Tergeste\" in \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\" (51 BC), in which he recounts events of the Gallic Wars.\nIn imperial times the border of Roman Italy moved from the Timavo River to Formione (today Risano). Roman Tergeste flourished due to its position on the road from Aquileia, the main Roman city in the area, to Istria, and as a port, some ruins of which are still visible. Emperor Augustus built a line of walls around the city in 33–32 BC, while Trajan built a theatre in the 2nd century. At the same time, the citizens of the town were enrolled in the tribe Pupinia. In 27 BC, 1dedf37c92f33ff4 was incorporated in \"Regio X\" of Augustan \"Italia\".\nIn the early Christian era 1dedf37c92f33ff4 continued to flourish. Between 138 and 161 AD, its territory was enlarged and nearby Carni and Catali were granted Roman citizenship by the Roman Senate and Emperor Antoninus Pius at the pleading of a leading Tergestine citizen, the \"quaestor urbanus\", Fabius Severus.\nAlready at the time of the Roman Empire there was a fishing village called Vallicula (\"small valley\") in the Barcola area. Remains of richly decorated Roman villas, including wellness facilities, piers and extensive gardens suggest that Barcola was already a place for relaxation among the Romans because of its favourable microclimate, as it was located directly on the sea and protected from the Bora. At that time, Pliny the Elder mentioned the vines of the wine Pulcino (\"Vinum Pucinum\" - probably today's \"Prosecco\"), which were grown on the slopes.\nLate Antiquity.\nThe city was witness to the Battle of the Frigidus in the Vipava Valley in AD 394, in which Theodosius I defeated Eugenius.

        "content": "4e4e176045371a15, or cell division cycle 6, is a protein in eukaryotic cells. It is mainly studied in the budding yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" . It is an essential regulator of DNA replication and plays important roles in the activation and maintenance of the checkpoint mechanisms in the cell cycle that coordinate S phase and mitosis. It is part of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) and is required for loading minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins onto the DNA, an essential step in the initiation of DNA synthesis. In addition, it is a member of the family of AAA+ ATPases and highly related to ORC1; both are the same protein in archaea. \nFunction.\nCDC6 is an ATP binding protein and a member of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) together with the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdt1 and the MCM complex (containing MCM2-7p). CDC6 assembles after ORC in an ATP dependent manner and is required for loading MCM proteins onto the DNA. Reconstruction of electron microscope images showed that the ORC-CDC6 complex forms a ring-shaped structure with similar dimensions to those of ring-shaped MCM helicase. A near-atomic resolution model of the entire ORC-4e4e176045371a15-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex with DNA was assembled from EM data in 2017.\nIt is thought that the CDC6-Cdt1 complex uses ATP hydrolysis to thread DNA through the central hole of the MCM doughnut. Mutations in the binding motif of CDC6 strongly suggest that ATP binding and hydrolysis is essential for its function. The minimal requirement for DNA binding has been mapped within its 47-amino acid sequence. Furthermore, 4e4e176045371a15 indirectly inhibits activation of the p34cdc2/CDC28 M phase kinase, thus nuclear division is suppressed.\nRegulation.\nCDC6 is normally present at high levels during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This is partly because the CDC6 gene is only transcribed during G1 phase. On the onset of the S phase, CDC6 gets phosphorylated by the Cdc28-Clb5-Clb6 complex (Cdk2) and consequently becoming inactivated. This has been shown by introducing mutations in CDC6 at the consensus sites for Cdk2 phosphorylation (near the N-terminus) which inhibit degradation. The phosphorylation can furthermore be catalyzed by Cdc28-Cln. The inactivated CDC6 is then targeted for degradation by SCFCDC4-dependent ubiquitinylation and afterwards degraded by the proteasome. Thus, the regulation of CDC6 is tightly correlated to the activity of Cdk2 and since Cdk2-activity is oscillating once per cell cycle, the accumulation and degradation of CDC6 also oscillates.\nTwo states can be distinguished. In the first state (during G1 phase) Cdk2-activity is low, CDC6 can accumulate, hence the pre-RC can be formed but not activated. In the second state Cdk2-activity is high, CDC6 becomes inactivated, hence the pre-RC is activated but not formed. This change assures that DNA replication is performed only once per cell cycle. It has been shown that overexpression of CDC6 does not induce re-replication in cognate cells, probably due to inhibition through CDK that resets the cell\ncycle clock to G1. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that regulation of CDC6 is one of several redundant mechanisms that prevent re-replication of the DNA in eukaryotic cells.\nStructure.\nThe crystallographic structure of a 4e4e176045371a15/Orc1-related protein from the archaeon \"Pyrobaculum aerophilum\" has been solved and three structural domains have been identified. Domain I and II form the ATP binding/hydrolysis site and are similar to other AAA+ ATPases. Domain III is structurally related to a winged-helix domain, thus may interact with origin DNA. From studies with E. coli γ clamp loading complex, it was suggested that domain III mediates protein-protein interactions with other AAA+ ATPases in the pre-RC, thus suggesting that the CDC6 builds a homodimer in its native form. The domains I and II form a cashew-shaped molecule that bind ATP in the cleft and additionally build the sensor motif for ATP/ADP recognition. These domains are also thought to mediate subsequent conformational changes. Nevertheless, the exact functional roles of these domains remain unclear.\nDisease.\nIt has been shown CDC6 shows proto-oncogenic activity. 4e4e176045371a15 overexpression interferes with the expression of INK4/ARF tumor suppressor genes through a mechanism involving the epigenetic modification of chromatin at the INK4/ARF locus. In addition, CDC6 overexpression in primary cells may promote DNA hyperreplication and induce a senescence response similar to that caused by oncogene activation. These findings indicate that deregulation of CDC6 expression in human cells poses a serious risk of carcinogenesis. Down-regulation of CDC6 in prostate cancer was observed and associated with phenotypic characteristics of aggressive prostate cancer. Furthermore, it has been\nobserved that ",

That year, it merged with the United 6de80fa20134a6f6 of America (UPCUSA) to form the Presbyterian Church (USA).\nHistory.\nOrganization (1861).\nThe 6de80fa20134a6f6 grew out of regional and theological divisions within the 6de80fa20134a6f6 of America (PCUSA), the first national Presbyterian denomination in the U.S. founded in 1789. In 1838, the PCUSA divided along theological lines due to the Old School–New School Controversy. The New School faction advocated revivalism and a softening of traditional Calvinism, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession, the Presbyterian Church's doctrinal standard. Many New School Presbyterians were also supportive of moral reform movements, such as abolitionism.\nAs a result, after 1838 most Southern Presbyterians aligned with the Old School Presbyterian Church. The reluctance of the Old School General Assembly to rule on moral and political questions not explicitly addressed in the Bible resulted in the Northern and Southern sections of the Old School Presbyterian Church staying united longer than their New School counterparts. The latter split over slavery in 1858. New School synods and presbyteries in the South established the pro-slavery United Synod of the South.\nOld School Presbyterians remained united until after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War. In May 1861, the Old School General Assembly passed the controversial Gardiner Spring Resolutions that called on Presbyterians to support the Federal Government of the United States as a religious duty. Southerners, with support from a minority of Northerners, protested that this action violated the spirituality of the church and required Southerners to commit treason against their home states in order to remain members of the church.\nAfter the May meeting of the General Assembly, some presbyteries in the South immediately renounced the jurisdiction of the General Assembly. On August 15, a convention in Atlanta, Georgia, representing 17 presbyteries, encouraged all presbyteries who had not done so to renounce the General Assembly's jurisdiction. It also recommended that the constitution of the church remain unchanged, with the exception of replacing the phrase \"6de80fa20134a6f6 of America\" with the name \"Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America\". A general assembly was scheduled to meet in Augusta, Georgia, on December 4, and by that time 47 presbyteries and 10 synods had severed ties to PCUSA. The first General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church accepted the recommendations of the convention and elected Benjamin M. Palmer its first moderator.\nPostwar years (1865–1900).\nAfter the Confederacy's defeat, the church renamed itself as the \"6de80fa20134a6f6\". The denomination grew during its early years in part due to the absorption of a number of smaller Presbyterian groups. In 1864, the church re-united with Southern New School Presbyterians when it merged with the United Synod of the South. Between 1867 and 1874, the church welcomed the Patapsco Presbytery of Maryland, the Kentucky Synod, and the Missouri Synod after those jurisdictions withdrew from the Old School PCUSA in protest over political actions taken by that denomination. Between 1867 and 1870, the church absorbed the Alabama and Kentucky Presbyteries of the Associate Reformed Church, a denomination with roots in the Covenanter and Seceder traditions of Scottish Presbyterianism. These and other mergers added over 35,000 members and 490 local churches.\nIn the 1880s, the PCUS endured a prolonged battle over Darwinian evolution. James Woodrow, professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, sparked controversy when he suggested that evolutionary thought did not contradict the biblical teachings on creation. In response, the Synod of South Carolina, in which the seminary was located, prohibited the teaching of evolution in 1884. Similar actions were taken by the synods of Georgia, South Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Columbia's board of directors was reorganized, and it voted to fire Woodrow. He refused to vacate his position and appealed to Augusta Presbytery, which exonerated him of any heresy in August 1886. This decision was appealed to the General Assembly, which after five days of debate ordered Woodrow's removal from his professorship. Despite his removal, Woodrow continued to be considered a member in good standing of the PCUS and was elected moderator of the South Carolina Synod in 1901. Nevertheless, the overwhelming sentiment of the PCUS was that evolutionary theory was a threat to Christian orthodoxy. As a result, Southern Presbyterians would disengage from scientific developments for more than a generation.\nLater history.\nAfter the war, the PCUS retained its \"Old School\" Presbyterian emphasis until the 20th century. The PCUS leaders began to emphasize that they needed to change in light of the changing South, which was undergoing urbanization and industrialization.\nA point of contention were talks of merger between the mainline \"Northern Presbyterians,\" the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and its successor denomination, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. A vote for merger had come up in 1954, and despite popular support among many, the vote to merge failed. The two denominations did collaborate on a joint hymnal. The PCUS also joined the Episcopalians, United Methodists, the United Church of Christ and the UPCUSA in the Consultation on Church Union in 1962, a group begun by UPCUSA stated clerk Eugene Carson Blake. Eventually, by 1968, union churches and presbyteries were formed (that is, members of both the UPCUSA and the PCUS), and in 1970, a \"Plan of Union\" was drawn up. Union did not take place for another thirteen years.\nAnother important event occurred in 1965, when Rachel Henderlite became the first woman ordained in the ",

        "label": "0134a6f6",
        "ext_content": "; she was ordained by the Hanover Presbytery in Virginia.\nThe response to the civil rights movement in effect split the PCUS into three factions: a liberal group desiring full endorsement of the movement's platform, a moderate faction desiring church-wide consensus before taking positive action, and a conservative/traditionalist group vigorously opposing what it believed was the meddling of the church in the civil and cultural traditions of its native region. Conservatives argued that church activity on behalf of racial desegregation and voting rights constituted a violation of the doctrine of \"the spirituality of the church,\" a principle developed by 19th-century Presbyterian theologian James Henley Thornwell. He had declared that social reform and political participation were duties or pursuits to be taken up by individuals, not church courts. The conservative group strongly defended that teaching, but the liberal critics believed the doctrine was a justification for maintaining racial segregation and preserving the social standing of historic upper-class white elites within Southern society, a fair percentage of whom were PCUS members.\nHaving been eventually defeated numerous times in the General Assembly by a coalition of the liberals and moderates from the 1960s onward, some PCUS conservatives, primarily from non-metropolitan parts of the Deep South, founded what today is the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) in late 1973. They cited its rationale as \"[a] long-developing theological liberalism which denied the deity of Jesus Christ and the inerrancy and authority of Scripture\" on the part of PCUS leaders. Some evangelicals, however, remained in the PCUS in order to contend for their beliefs; this group was more willing to perceive common cause with UPCUSA conservatives",

In 1989, work began on two possible sites to take both intermediate and low-level waste near Dounreay in Caithness and near Sellafield in Cumbria. Following preliminary investigations at both sites, b58f63251fc2902f announced plans in October 1992 to build a “Rock Characterisation Facility” (RCF) at Sellafield. b58f63251fc2902f critics including Cumbria County Council, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace argued that the RCF was an integral part of b58f63251fc2902f's repository plans and in effect a 'trojan horse' for an intended nuclear waste repository. It was also successfully argued that the RCF proposal was scientifically flawed and that b58f63251fc2902f's scientific knowledge was insufficient to prove that disposal was safe for any site. In 1997, following a five-month local planning inquiry, the Secretary of State for the Environment rejected b58f63251fc2902f's case. \nThe Inquiry Inspector said \"chemical containment is new and untried, with more experimentation and modelling development indubitably required.

This area was mainly developed under British occupation when ceded by Nawab of Murshidabad after the Battle of Plassey. With the establishment of the Howrah Railway Terminus in 1854 started the most important phase of its industrial development. Flour mills were established in 1855, followed by jute mills and around the 1870s, there were five mills near Howrah Station. The Howrah–Shalimar Railway Section and the Shalimar Terminus were constructed in 1883. e8e9e05604076cb5 was also a major railway junction of Martin's Light Railways.\ne8e9e05604076cb5 was turned into an industrial area during World War II. A high demand of iron lead to the establishment of a number of small and medium-sized iron-casting industries. Gradually the city of Howrah was called as Sheffield of Bengal when Mr. Alamohan Das established a large factory township named Dasnagar. A large number of machines/ tools/ precision instruments manufacturing factories were established.\nAll the above reasons result to a flow of population from rural belts of Howrah, Hooghly and Midnapur districts to this area to meet the high demand of labour. Gradually, this area has become a densely populated area with the location advantage of industries of Dasnagar in west, Howrah Railway Terminus in east.\nThe rapid growth of population and negligence of planned infrastructure of the British Government and then flux of people from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) leads to a breakdown of infrastructure of unplanned and narrow roads. The economic decline of West Bengal after partition of India also causes a big blow to Howrah's famous jute and machine-tools industries.\nRecent developments.\nCurrently e8e9e05604076cb5 is mainly a residential area, but still there exist significant number of private small scaled industrial infrastructures. The population is mainly divided into few economic classes. There is a working class who temporarily stay in this town and work in the small scaled iron-casting, machine tools and precision instruments industries. A number of people also work in different Government and Private service sectors. Also few are engaged with small-scaled businesses.\nAfter the famous Vidyasagar Setu was established, this town has become well-connected with Kolkata by both Vidyasagar Setu and Howrah Bridge. e8e9e05604076cb5 is connected to Kona Expressway by Dr. Bholanath Chakraborty Sarani (Formerly Drainage Canal Road), which was built by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Kona Expressway serves as a connector of Kolkata (via Vidyasagar Setu) to National Highway 16 and hence is a part of the Golden Quadrilateral project. At Nibra town of Howrah district, Kona Expressway joins with NH 16.\nA recent on-going development of Kolkata Metro from Salt Lake Sector-5 to Howrah Maidan will also increase the significance of e8e9e05604076cb5 as it is only 3 km distant from Howrah Maidan. This railway connection (Kolkata Metro Line 2) is under construction by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation.\nTransport.\nBus.\nBuses ply along Deshapran Shasmal Road (Panchanantala Road), Narasingha Dutta Road, New HIT Road, Belilious Road and Natabar Paul Road in e8e9e05604076cb5.\nTrain.\nDasnagar railway station and Tikiapara railway station on South Eastern line are the nearest railway stations of e8e9e05604076cb5.

        "content": "The f23e50c34bd306f4 are an exclusively marine class of the phylum Cnidaria, referred to as the true jellyfish (or \"true jellies\").\nThe class name f23e50c34bd306f4 comes from the Greek word \"skyphos\" , denoting a kind of drinking cup and alluding to the cup shape of the organism.\nf23e50c34bd306f4ns have existed from the earliest Cambrian to the present.\nBiology.\nMost species of f23e50c34bd306f4 have two life-history phases, including the planktonic medusa or polyp form, which is most evident in the warm summer months, and an inconspicuous, but longer-lived, bottom-dwelling polyp, which seasonally gives rise to new medusae. Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are f23e50c34bd306f4. They typically range from in diameter, but the largest species, \"Cyanea capillata\" can reach across. Scyphomedusae are found throughout the world's oceans, from the surface to great depths; no f23e50c34bd306f4 occur in freshwater (or on land).\nAs medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. The nematocysts are located throughout the tentacles that radiate downward from the edge of the umbrella dome, and also cover the four or eight oral arms that hang down from the central mouth. Some species, however, are instead filter feeders, using their tentacles to strain plankton from the water.\nAnatomy.\nf23e50c34bd306f4ns usually display a four-part symmetry and have an internal gelatinous material called mesoglea, which provides the same structural integrity as a skeleton. The mesoglea includes mobile amoeboid cells originating from the epidermis.\nf23e50c34bd306f4ns have no durable hard parts, including no head, no skeleton, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion. Marine jellyfish can consist of as much as 98% water, so are rarely found in fossil form.\nUnlike the hydrozoan jellyfish, Hydromedusae, Scyphomedusae lack a vellum, which is a circular membrane beneath the umbrella that helps propel the (usually smaller) Hydromedusae through the water. However, a ring of muscle fibres is present within the mesoglea around the rim of the dome, and the jellyfish swims by alternately contracting and relaxing these muscles. The periodic contracting and relaxing propels the jellyfish through the water, allowing it to escape predation or catch its prey.\nThe mouth opens into a central stomach, from which four interconnected diverticula radiate outwards. In many species, this is further elaborated by a system of radial canals, with or without an additional ring canal towards the edge of the dome. Some genera, such as \"Cassiopea\", even have additional, smaller mouths in the oral arms. The lining of the digestive system includes further stinging nematocysts, along with cells that secrete digestive enzymes.\nThe nervous system usually consists of a distributed net of cells, although some species possess more organised nerve rings. In species lacking nerve rings, the nerve cells are instead concentrated into small structures called \"rhopalia\". There are between four and sixteen of these small lobes arranged around the rim of the umbrella, where they coordinate the muscular action allowing the animal to move. Each rhopalium is typically associated with a pair of sensory pits, a statocyst, and sometimes a pigment-cup ocellus.\nReproduction.\nMost species appear to be gonochorists, with separate male and female individuals. The gonads are located in the stomach lining, and the mature gametes are expelled through the mouth. After fertilization, some species brood their young in pouches on the oral arms, but they are more commonly planktonic.\nGrowth and development.\nThe fertilized egg produces a planular larva which, in most species, quickly attaches itself to the sea bottom. The larva develops into the hydroid stage of the lifecycle, a tiny sessile polyp called a scyphistoma. The scyphistoma reproduces asexually, producing similar polyps by budding, and then either transforming into a medusa, or budding several medusae off from its upper surface via a process called strobilation. The medusae are initially microscopic and may take years to reach sexual maturity.\nCommercial importance.\nf23e50c34bd306f4 include the moon jelly \"Aurelia aurita\", in the order Semaeostomeae, and the enormous \"Nemopilema nomurai\", in the order Rhizostomeae, found between Japan and China and which in some years causes major fisheries disruptions.\nThe jellyfish fished commercially for food are Scyphomedusae in the order Rhizostomeae. Most rhizostome jellyfish live in warm water.\nTaxonomy.\nAlthough the f23e50c34bd306f4 were formerly considered to include the animals now referred to as the classes Cubozoa and Staurozoa, they now include just three extant orders (two of which are in Discomedusae, a subclass of ",

The trophy was originally donated and managed by McGill University to serve as an annual, often pre-season, invitational football contest between the sister universities of McGill and UBC in aid of the Canadian Paraplegic Association. The ad9df33e08faf64c was retired in 2003 and replaced by the Mitchell Bowl.\nHistory.\nThe ad9df33e08faf64c was originally created for Canadian University football invitational competition in 1953. The trophy was a sculpture created by R. Tait McKenzie entitled \"The Onslaught\".\nMany of the games were regarded as an unofficial national championship of Canada, although three other university football leagues were not invited to play and disputed this claim. From 1953 through 1958 the game was a pre-season interconference exhibition. In 1959 and 1960, the ad9df33e08faf64c was switched to a post-season game, pitting the Yates Cup and Hardy Trophy champions against each other in the first attempt in an unofficial national championship. There were eleven unofficial national championship or challenge games played between 1953 and 1964.\nStaging games could prove to be difficult at times. In 1961 the Queen's Golden Gaels were the Yates Cup champions scheduled to play the Western Canadian Hardy Cup champion Alberta Golden Bears. However, the Ontario Intercollegiate Football Conference champion McMaster Marauders challenged Queen's to a post-season match which the Gaels were forced to play. With no game scheduled, the McGill Redmen hosted the Jewett Trophy champion St. Francis Xavier X-Men.\nIn 1963, the Hardy and Yates champions again faced off in the \"Golden Bowl\" between the Alberta Golden Bears and Queen's Golden Gaels, but McGill chose to hold onto to ad9df33e08faf64c and play the Atlantic champion St. FX for a third consecutive year. Alberta's 25-7 victory marked the first major western victory over an eastern team, with McGill also losing to the X-Men in the Churchill. These events spurred an effort to create an official national championship.\nWhen the Vanier Cup was staged as an official national championship in 1965, the trophy was retired. From 1968 to 1988 one of the national semi-final games was variously named Western Bowl, Forest City Bowl and Central Bowl.\nIn 1989, the CIAU requested and were given permission by the trustees of the trophy to reinstate the award for annual presentation to the winner of the National semi-final game, the ad9df33e08faf64c. The trophy was taken out of storage at McGill and presented as the winner of this game. The winner of the Atlantic Bowl would meet the winner of the ad9df33e08faf64c for the Vanier Cup. In 2003, the ad9df33e08faf64c game was renamed the Uteck Bowl in honour of Larry Uteck. The trophy was retired for the second time.\n",
